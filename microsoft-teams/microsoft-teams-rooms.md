    Teams Rooms run software that’s built on top of the powerful Teams platform and designed for use on Teams Rooms devices and shared hybrid meeting scenarios.

    Teams Rooms is scalable across a variety of meeting spaces, with a spectrum of Teams certified devices from various manufacturers. Microsoft Teams certification is a badge of quality for select audio and video devices. It tells you Microsoft and its partners worked together to optimize these devices for use with Microsoft Teams and that both Microsoft and the device manufacturers stand behind your solution. Check out the list of certified [Microsoft Teams Rooms devices](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/across-devices/devices/category/teams-rooms/20).

- ### How much does Microsoft Teams Rooms Pro cost?

- ### What are Signature Microsoft Teams Rooms?
    
    Signature Teams Rooms are designed with next-generation room standards, making collaboration easier and interactions more engaging and inclusive across your meeting spaces. In medium and large spaces, a curved table encircles the audiovisual (AV) equipment stack and faces a large, 21:9 aspect ratio display to foster more immersive connections with remote participants. For smaller rooms, a gumdrop or guitar pick-shaped table helps achieve that same degree of face-to-face engagement.

    Why is speaker recognition in meeting rooms important?
    
    Many are struggling to efficiently capture and act on key insights in hybrid meetings. The answer to this problem is Copilot in every space, beginning with Teams Rooms. Copilot relies on detailed transcripts with speaker attribution to deliver accurate summaries, insights, action items, and intelligent response to queries about a meeting. Without this, individual contributions are lost and only identified as the room or speaker 1, Speaker 2 etc. By recognizing all individuals, intelligent recaps in [Teams Premium](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/premium) and Copilot can greatly enhance productivity for all. Learn more about speaker recognition, local regulation compliance, how we protect biometric data and steps to enable for your organization at [aka.ms/speakerrecblog](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2296993).

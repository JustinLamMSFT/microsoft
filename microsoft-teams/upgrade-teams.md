## Frequently asked questions

Expand all | Collapse all

- ### What is the right plan for my business?
    
    Teams Essentials is designed for a small business in need of an affordable, professional, easy-to-use meeting solution with video and audio calling. Teams Essentials allows you to enjoy meetings all day up to 30 hours, host up to 300 participants, and get 10 GB of cloud storage.
    
    To get the full Microsoft 365 experience, with access to apps like Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook, as well as an email domain and Exchange calendar integration, try Microsoft 365 Business Standard.
    
- ### How do I manage my Teams Essentials subscription and invite others to join? Would a small or medium-sized business need to purchase multiple accounts for its employees?
    
    Teams Essentials allows you to pay on behalf of up to 50 users. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Invite people to Microsoft 365**. Add each person’s first name, last name, and email addresses and choose **Send**. The people you added will receive an invitation email to add their user account information to Microsoft 365.
    
- ### What forms of payments can I use?
    
    Credit cards are accepted. We don’t accept PayPal, Venmo, and other similar services.  
    [Learn more about billing and payments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2181422).
    
- ### Once I upgrade, can I go back to the free version of Teams?
    
    No, once you upgrade and convert from a free account to a paid account, you can’t revert to the free version using the same email address. The email address associated with your converted account can no longer be associated with a free account. To create a new free account, use a different email address (both for the admin and for each user).
    
- ### Can I upgrade some users to Microsoft 365 and keep others on the free version of Teams?
    
    No, all users in your organization must be upgraded and will have access to the full version of Teams and all Microsoft 365 services. [Learn more about upgrading from the free version of Teams to a paid subscription](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2181341) (for admins).
    
- ### Can I upgrade from Teams Essentials to a Microsoft 365 subscription?
    
    Upgrades from Teams Essentials to Microsoft 365 will be available soon.
    
- ### Where can I find more information about how to manage my Teams Essentials account?
    
    Find more information here about administrative management of your Teams Essentials account.  
    [Learn more](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2181525)
    
- ### Can you purchase on behalf of a child?
    
    Yes. A child can’t purchase on their own.

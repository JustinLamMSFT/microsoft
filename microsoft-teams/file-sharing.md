## Frequently asked questions

Expand all | Collapse all

- ### How do I share files online in Microsoft Teams?
    
    Sharing files and coauthoring in Teams is easy—share files in a one-on-one chat, a group chat, or a team channel. Select the paperclip icon below the box where you type a message to upload a copy of your original file. Or upload a file by going to the Files tab of a chat and selecting Share.
    
- ### How much file share storage do I get?
    
    Files that you share in a channel are stored in your team's SharePoint folder, which is found in the Files tab at the top of each channel.
    
    Files that you share in a private or group chat are stored in your OneDrive for Business folder, which is found in the Files tab at the top of a chat. These files are only shared with the people in that conversation.
    
    [Learn more](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2132719) about how SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business interact with Microsoft Teams.
    
- ### Can I share a file with someone outside my team?
    
    Only team members can see team files. To share a file with colleagues outside your team but within your organization, send it to them in a Teams chat.
    
    If you want to share a file with someone outside your organization, open the file in Microsoft 365 on the web or a Microsoft 365 app and share it from there.
    
- ### How do I coedit a file in Teams?
    
    Files uploaded and shared to a team are accessible to every member of it. Using Microsoft 365 on the web, Microsoft 365 for Android or iOS, or the latest applications from Microsoft 365, you and your team members can coedit Word, PowerPoint, or Excel documents or comment on Visio files. No need to check files out or worry about colleagues who have the document open—just open the file you want to edit, and if other team members are also editing it, your changes will be seamlessly merged as you work.
    
- ### Where can I find more about file share in Teams?

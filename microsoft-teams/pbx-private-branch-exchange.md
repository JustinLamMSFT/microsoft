## Frequently asked questions

Expand all | Collapse all

- ### What is a Private Branch Exchange (PBX)?
    
    Private Branch Exchanges are phone systems—private telephone networks—used in companies and organizations. They offer key capabilities and features for a business to operate. These often include auto attendant, contact center integration, voicemail, call queues, conferencing, and routing.
    
- ### What is Microsoft Teams Phone System?
    
    The Microsoft technology for enabling call control and PBX capabilities in the cloud with Microsoft Teams.
    
- ### Why use cloud-based Phone System versus an analog business phone system?
    
    Phone System gives you PBX capabilities, but without the complicated and expensive equipment. It allows you to replace your existing on-premises PBX system with a set of features delivered from Microsoft 365 or Office 365 that is tightly integrated into your cloud experience.
    
- ### How does Phone System work?
    
    With Phone System, users can choose Microsoft Teams to place and receive calls, transfer calls, and mute or unmute calls. Phone System users can click a name in their address book, and place Teams calls to that person. To place and receive calls, Phone System users can use their mobile devices, a headset with a laptop or PC, or one of many IP phones that work with Teams. Phone System administrators can manage calling options and settings from the same console used for messaging, collaboration, and so on.
    
    Calls between users in your organization are handled internally within Phone System, and never go to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). This applies to calls between users in your organization located in different geographical areas, removing long-distance costs on these internal calls.

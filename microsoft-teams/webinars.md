## Frequently asked questions

Expand all | Collapse all

- ### What’s a webinar?
    
    The word “webinar” is a combination of “seminar” and “web,” and it could be a presentation, a lecture, a workshop, or another event hosted online. Webinars and virtual events platforms are used to build engagement and relationships; enable hybrid work; empower communication and collaboration with employees working remotely and in different locations; and inform, demonstrate, and teach.
    
- ### How are webinars different from ordinary meetings?
    
    Ordinary meetings generally include a lot of back and forth among the participants—having discussions, sharing, assigning and accepting tasks, making plans, and working toward consensus.
    
    Webinars, on the other hand, are more controlled, and the participants have clearer roles. One or more experts (the presenters) share their ideas or provide training to an audience (the attendees or participants).
    
- ### Who can schedule a webinar?
    
    Anyone who can schedule a Teams meeting can schedule a webinar. If you’re unable to schedule one, check with your IT admin.
    
- ### Who can register for a webinar in Teams?
    
    Anyone can register, but your IT admin can restrict registration to people in your organization. You may also choose to restrict registration when you schedule the webinar.
    
- ### How do I follow up with attendees after a webinar?
    
    After your webinar, create customer journeys and send personalized follow-up emails to your attendees using [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Marketing](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2182125).
    
- ### What’s the difference between webinars in Office 365, Microsoft 365, and Teams Premium?
    
    Webinars in Office 365 and Microsoft 365 subscriptions add basic webinar functionality to Microsoft Teams Enterprise, such as registration for up to 1,000 attendees, a co-organizer role, interactivity with Q&A, attendee reporting, and Dynamics 365 Marketing options. Advanced webinars in Teams Premium include all of the basic webinar functionality but with new host controls and event management controls that help you seamlessly connect with any audience. Some of these advanced features include automated reminder emails, a registration waitlist and manual approval, a virtual green room, and the ability to manage what attendees see on screen.

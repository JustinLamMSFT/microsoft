     What is Teams Phone and how does it work?
    
    Teams subscriptions include Teams Phone, which enables calls from one Teams app to another. The ability to make and receive calls to and from landlines and mobile phones through the PSTN is available as an add-on with the Teams Phone Standard, Teams Phone with Calling Plan, or Microsoft 365 E5 subscriptions. These options provide a cloud-based phone system in Teams with features such as hold, blind and safe transfers, and reporting features for professionals who manage calling solutions. As of October 2023, some Microsoft 365 and Office 365 suites no longer include Teams. Subscribers to those plans must purchase a Teams license separately.  
    Teams Phone replaces traditional PBXs and enables key calling capabilities with a cloud-based call control system that provides the overall telephony workload for Teams.
    
- 02/
    
    What are my options for making outbound calls via Teams Phone through the PSTN?
    
    Teams Phone provides complete PBX capabilities for your organization, enabling you to make calls with other Teams users through the Teams app. However, if you need to make calls to numbers outside of your organization, you’ll need to connect to the PSTN. Teams Phone provides valuable flexibility for connecting to the PSTN, through Teams Calling Plans, Teams Phone Mobile, Operator Connect, and/or Direct Routing.
    
- 03/
    
    What are Teams Calling Plans?
    
    A Teams Calling Plan provides customers with a primary phone number and calling minutes to make and receive phone calls. A domestic calling plan can be added to Teams Phone or added to Microsoft 365 E5. As of October 2023, some Microsoft 365 and Office 365 suites no longer include Teams. Subscribers to those plans must purchase a Teams license separately. [Check market availability](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2261913). [View detailed calling rates](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/audio-conferencing#layout-container-uid2899) for calls made outside your subscription plan.

     What is Teams Phone with Calling Plan?
    
    A Teams Phone with Calling Plan package is a cloud-based phone system that enables users to make, receive, and transfer calls to and from landlines and mobile phones through the PSTN in Teams. Teams Phone with Calling Plan includes a phone system and a domestic calling plan. [Learn more](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2141577).  
    Teams Phone with Calling Plan is designed for customers using Microsoft 365 that are seeking a modern phone system. Teams Phone with Calling Plan can be added onto Microsoft Teams Essentials, Microsoft Teams Enterprise, or Microsoft 365 and Office 365 subscriptions that have a Teams license. A prepaid wallet (known as [Communications Credits](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2141636)) is available for adding toll-free, additional minutes, and other pay-per-minute charges.  
    An optional international calling plan that includes 600 minutes per person per month can be purchased as an add-on. [Check market availability](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2226089).

    Can I use my existing phone numbers?

- 06/
    
    What types of phones and calling devices are supported?
    
    Microsoft partners with Yealink, Crestron, Lenovo, Polycom, and AudioCodes to develop and certify a wide portfolio of desk phones, conference phones, meeting room systems and headsets that deliver high-quality and reliable calling experiences for Teams.

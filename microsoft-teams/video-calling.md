## Frequently asked questions

Expand all | Collapse all

- ### What’s the difference between a phone call and a video call?
    
    Phone calling or conference calling is a phone call between two or more participants with audio input and output. Video calling or video conferencing is a call between two or more participants that provides video, as well as audio, input, and output. It provides the benefit of being able to see the expressions and reactions of other people on the call, in addition to being able to hear what they’re saying.
    
- ### What are the advantages of video calling?
    
    Video calling and conferencing enables real-time collaboration, increases productivity, saves time, and helps people who are working remote feel less isolated and more engaged. If participants in a group video call, or video conference, don’t feel like being on camera, they can always opt to turn it off and just leave their microphone on. Some [video calling and conferencing solutions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/video-conferencing) even allow people to [blur or change their background](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/virtual-meeting-backgrounds) to add privacy without losing the ability to connect face to face.
    
- ### Why are video calling and conferencing important now?
    
    Remote work and working from home have increased dramatically so being able to communicate and collaborate in real time with a video call or conference fosters productivity, participation, and morale. During times that keep people apart, video calling helps fulfill our need to work and be together.
    
- ### Why use a video calling software application?
    
    There are many benefits to using a software application (app) developed for real-time online collaboration such as video calling and conferencing in addition to other capabilities including file sharing and calendaring. That’s because the software is designed specifically to create a better overall experience for people who want to chat, call, and collaborate online—anywhere and anytime. What’s more, a [video calling and conferencing application](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software/) that’s integrated seamlessly with an entire [suite of productivity apps](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365)—versus a stand-alone app—provides additional timesaving, workflow, and ease-of-use benefits.

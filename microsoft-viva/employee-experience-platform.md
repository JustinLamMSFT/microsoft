# What is an employee experience platform?

An employee experience platform is software that supports people and teams by helping organizations improve connections, gain insights, find shared purpose, and encourage growth. Employee experience platforms are designed to improve [employee wellbeing](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2254309) in many ways, such as encouraging professional development and learning, which in turn boosts productivity, heightens morale, and keeps people aligned on business goals.

## Why should businesses use an employee experience platform?

Businesses should use an employee experience platform to help keep employees engaged and satisfied, improve employee retention, and increase productivity and profitability.

If you’ve worked for more than one organization in your career, then you’re likely familiar with how different the employee experience can be from job to job—even if the positions you held were similar. This is because [organizational culture](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/business-insights-ideas/resources/what-is-organizational-culture) plays a huge role in how people feel about their jobs, not just their everyday responsibilities. 

For example, someone who’s held a position for long enough to feel confident in their job may eventually start to feel less challenged or, worse, bored. If someone in this situation worked at a job with an employee experience platform, they’d be supported throughout their time at the organization—from the onboarding experience through future seniority—to help prevent any stagnation or burnout periods. 

The benefits of using an employee experience platform are impressive:

- A majority **(94%) of employees would stay at their company longer if it invested in their learning and development**.<sup><a aria-label="Footnote 1" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-viva/employee-experience-platform#footnote1" class="ms-rte-link">1</a></sup>
- **Employees who report having clarity about their work priorities are more than four times as likely to say they’re happy** at their current company.<sup><a aria-label="Footnote 2" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-viva/employee-experience-platform#footnote2" class="ms-rte-link">2</a></sup>
- Organizations with **highly engaged employees have 23% greater profitability**.<sup><a aria-label="Footnote 3" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-viva/employee-experience-platform#footnote3" class="ms-rte-link">3</a></sup>

## How do employee experience platforms work?

Employee experience platforms vary from product to product, but usually include:

- **A centralized app with a dashboard** that gives a high-level overview of the different categories and options available.
- **Connection to HR systems**, such as a self-service payroll portal, benefits information, and company policies.
- **Communication and collaboration tools**, such as a chat for your direct team or different interest groups.
- **Options for** **personalizing and customizing** the layout of your dashboard and the content appears there.
- **A place for** **employee goals, feedback, and surveys**.
- **A professional development category** for taking and assigning courses.
- **Analytics and insights** that show a snapshot of your work trends.

By combining all these tools into one place, you simplify the employee experience and eliminate the need to toggle back and forth between many different apps.

## What are the main features of an employee experience platform?

Here’s an example of how an employee experience platform might be structured.

### Insights

- **Allowing managers to give and ask employees for feedback** about their performance and needs through research-backed survey questions.
- **Providing sentiment analysis** to determine employee engagement.
- **Showing data on how much time employees spend in meetings** versus the time available for focused work.
- **Suggesting a one-on-one meeting** between a supervisor and direct report if it’s been a long time since they checked in.
- **Offering reports on after-hours work and quiet time** to help managers understand how hybrid work affects flexible schedules and employees’ ability to unplug.
- **Catching problematic work patterns** that may eventually lead to stress and burnout.

### Professional growth

- **Having a centralized place for professional development courses** where employees can learn at their own pace and ask questions.
- Enabling managers to share and **build courses that are customized to individual employees**.
- Connecting employees to answers by **crowdsourcing knowledge from across an organization**.

### Community and connection

- **Strengthening the digital employee experience**—which is key in hybrid work environments—through personalized curation of news, tasks, and resources.
- **Bringing people together** through digital communities, virtual events, and conversation tools.
- **Giving managers data about their own work habits** to encourage modeling of healthy behavior for their teams.

### Sense of purpose

- **Using an** [**objectives and key results (OKRs) framework**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2254310) to help managers define team goals.
- Being able to **easily update goal progress, so employees can see how their results affect other efforts**.
- **Showing managers how much time they’ve spent with new hires** to help ensure they’re properly supported.

## What’s the difference between employee experience platforms and employee engagement platforms?

Employee experience platforms and employee engagement platforms are closely related but not the same. Typically, an [employee engagement platform](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/business-insights-ideas/resources/what-is-employee-engagement-software) focuses on measuring how engaged employees are but doesn’t suggest actions to improve that engagement. With an employee experience platform, organizations have the added benefit of collecting engagement data _and_ receiving recommendations for how to improve engagement, which makes the tool more thorough than employee engagement platforms.

## How do I implement an employee experience platform?

To set up a new employee experience platform at your organization, consider taking the following steps:

1. **Meet with key stakeholders**. Depending on how large your organization is and how it’s structured, you may want to form a committee responsible for choosing and adopting the employee experience platform. Make sure at least one representative from all relevant departments is included to get the most well-rounded set of perspectives. Human resources should play a major role in this effort.
2. **Establish your goals for the technology**. Innovative technology is only as strong as the effort and intent put behind it. What do you hope to gain by implementing an employee experience platform? How will you measure if it’s successfully meeting those goals?
3. **Research employee experience platforms that can help meet your goals**. For example, if you’d like to improve employee retention, do the platforms you’re considering have features that not only measure that metric but also make multiple suggestions for what to do if you’re struggling to meet your goal?
4. **Try before you buy**. Sometimes what sounds great in theory isn’t as great in practice. Be sure to demo your top choices among committee members and discuss anything that felt confusing, wasn’t what you expected, or could be a potential hurdle for employee use.
5. **Roll it out slowly**. Once you’ve selected an employee experience platform, it may be useful to first train a select group of employees on it before rolling it out organization-wide. This way, they can provide feedback about their experiences to help you better personalize the features for people’s needs and address any problems before everyone is using it.
6. **Provide training**. Now that you’ve fixed any initial kinks and received feedback, you’re ready to provide training to all employees and roll the platform out fully.
7. **Regroup as needed**. Meet with committee members when necessary to address any issues that arise and to help keep the employee experience with the platform as smooth as possible.

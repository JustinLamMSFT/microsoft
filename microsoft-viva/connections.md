## Frequently asked questions

Expand all | Collapse all

- ### What is Viva Connections?
    
    Viva Connections is the gateway to a modern employee experience. It helps the entire organization stay engaged and informed with seamless information sharing by providing employees with a curated experience that includes relevant news, conversations, and other resources—all in one place.
    
    In addition, Viva Connections provides a single, curated, employee destination to reinforce an organization’s identity with custom branding. It’s personalized and appears in the apps employees already use every day, like Microsoft Teams. By connecting everyone, from frontline workers to information workers, it unites them around the organization’s vision, mission, and strategic priorities. Organizations can deploy Viva Connections with minimal effort by building on existing capabilities in Microsoft 365, like SharePoint and Viva Engage. It also gives quick access to the rest of the Microsoft Viva applications that they are licensed to use, making it easy to navigate across different applications in one spot.
    
- ### Where can I access Viva Connections? Does the app exist outside of Microsoft Teams?
    
    Viva Connections works seamlessly with Microsoft Teams. It will be accessible via the Microsoft Teams desktop and mobile apps.
    
- ### How is Viva Connections different from other collaboration technology in Microsoft 365?
    
    Viva Connections integrates content from Microsoft 365 services—including  SharePoint, Teams, Viva Engage, Microsoft Stream, and others—into a consolidated and customizable “single pane” for every employee. It gives employees the tools they need to be successful via three interactive experiences:
    
    - A personalized feed to enable employees to explore news and contribute to the conversation from anywhere.
    - A personalized dashboard that serves as the company home for employees and is designed to be the central destination for everyone to discover resources and complete tasks.
    - A personalized resources area that allows them to get to the sites, communities, video playlists, and other content that matter most to them.
    
- ### Is Viva Connections only for corporate employees?
    
    No, Viva Connections is designed to be used by everyone in the organization. It can be customized for different employee groups, such as frontline workers who often have limited time to consume content and information during their shifts. Viva Connections can be configured to provide a comprehensive view of everything employees need, and minimize the time needed away from their core task.
    
- ### What is the relationship between Viva Connections and Viva Engage?
    
    Viva Connections is the home and gateway for Viva where people can find everything they need, including conversations, resources, and action items. It brings together community experiences—such as conversations, announcements, and storyline posts—from Viva Engage into the Viva Connections feed. Viva Engage is the social layer where employees can dive deep into communities, share their story, engage with coworkers, attend virtual events, and find belonging at work.
    
- ### How do security and privacy work in Viva Connections?
    
    Viva is built on intelligent security from Microsoft to provide privacy and security that organizations—and employees—can trust. While we know that data-driven insights and personalization are essential to business success, Microsoft believes strongly that privacy is a human right, and we’re  deeply committed to protecting the privacy of every person who uses our products.

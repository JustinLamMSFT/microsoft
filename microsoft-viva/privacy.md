When people use collaboration tools like chat, email, and calendar for everyday work, their digital footprints are captured in the Microsoft Graph. Viva Insights applies intelligence to this data to generate privacy-protected insights and recommendations to help people, teams, and organizations improve productivity and wellbeing. Personal insights are only visible to the individual and are stored in their mailbox. Individuals are never identifiable from the metrics presented to managers and leaders. The insights and recommendations are available in the flow of work through the Insights app in Teams, Viva Briefing email, monthly digest, Outlook add-in, and web.

## Frequently asked questions

Expand all | Collapse all

- ### Why am I receiving daily emails?
    
    The Briefing email from Microsoft Viva helps you prepare for the day ahead by surfacing important reminders about outstanding commitments and requests, documents relevant to upcoming meetings, and suggested blocks of time that can be scheduled to focus on important work. Admins may enable the Briefing email by default, so you get immediate value from this personalized, private email at the beginning of your workday. To opt out of the Briefing email, select **Unsubscribe** in the footer of all Briefing emails.
    
- ### How does Viva Insights know who I need to follow up with, outstanding tasks I need to complete, or meetings I need to prepare for?
    
    Viva Insights processes data from Exchange Online email and calendar data, and chat and call signals from Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams. When you use these apps, Viva Insights converts this activity into personal insights and recommended actions through a set of calculations performed within your Exchange Online mailbox. The data that you see in personal insights from Viva Insights is information already available to you.
    
- ### I didn’t install the Viva Insights app in Teams. Why do I see it?
    
    Your admin can pin the Viva Insights app in Teams. If you didn’t pin the app, your admin did so on your behalf.
    
- ### Can my manager use Viva Insights to identify work norms and behaviors for specific team members or see anything about my personal collaboration habits?
    
    No. Managers can’t use Viva Insights to discern anything about a specific individual because of the differential privacy that Viva Insights uses. Additionally, the personal insights you see are only available to you, and your managers can’t access that information. The data is stored and protected in the same way as your email, calendar, and Teams information.
    
- ### Can my employer use Viva Insights to spy on me?
    
    Personal insights in Viva Insights is not designed to enable evaluation, tracking, automated decision making, profiling, or monitoring. Personal insights in Viva Insights has no mechanism or option that allows anyone but you to access the personalized information displayed through these surfaces, unless you purposefully and independently share it. Personal insights data provided by Viva Insights can’t be used for automated decision making or profiling.
    
- ### What does my manager see about me?
    
    Manager insights provide visibility into the overall team experience. Manager insights are protected by [differential privacy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2192301), which makes it impossible to discern the individual activities or metrics of any specific individual on the team. When data is processed for manager insights, Microsoft protects employee privacy and fully complies with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the same as for personal insights.
    
- ### How do I opt in or out of personal insights from Viva Insights?
    
    Opt in and out of personal insights and experiences at any time.
    
    - Use the [Viva Insights dashboard to opt in or out](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2191894) of your personal dashboard, Viva Insights Outlook add-in, inline suggestions in Outlook, and monthly email digests.
    - The daily Briefing email may be enabled by default. To stop receiving daily Briefing emails, select **Unsubscribe** in the email footer. To resubscribe, go to the [Briefing settings page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2192210).
    - To unpin or uninstall the Viva Insights app in Teams, right click on the Viva Insights app icon and select either **Unpin** or **Uninstall**.
    
- ### What can Microsoft see about me?

    ### How does Viva Learning differ from learning management systems?
    
    Viva Learning aggregates learning content from host systems (such as LMS providers) into a single hub for employee learning directly in Teams and across Microsoft 365. With social learning features built in, Viva Learning brings employee learning into the flow of work to maximize employee engagement and productivity.

    ### Is Viva Learning present in Microsoft 365 in addition to Teams?
    
    Yes. While the central hub for Viva Learning is in Teams, Microsoft is also incorporating learning experiences through Viva Learning into the rest of Microsoft 365. For example, learning items will show up in Microsoft Search across SharePoint, Bing, and Microsoft365.com.

    ### Which features are only available if I upgrade to the Viva Suite or standalone Viva Learning premium license?
    
    Upgrading beyond the M365-included version of Viva Learning in Teams unlocks several powerful features to enhance your culture of learning. With these licenses, you can connect your LMS to sync assignments and aggregate content from internal and external sources. Additionally, you gain access to critical admin capabilities such as learning adoption reports, content featuring, and learning academy curation.

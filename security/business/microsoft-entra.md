- ### What is Microsoft Entra?
    
    Microsoft Entra is the product family name for all identity and network access solutions from Microsoft. It’s part of the Microsoft Security portfolio, which also includes Microsoft Purview for compliance, Microsoft Priva for privacy, Microsoft Defender for cyberthreat protection and cloud security, and Microsoft Sentinel for security information and event management (SIEM).
    
    When Microsoft announced Microsoft Entra in May 2022, the Microsoft Entra product family consisted of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), Microsoft Entra Permissions Management, and Microsoft Entra Verified ID. The current product family has expanded beyond identity and access management into new market categories such as security service edge (SSE). Microsoft Entra is the unifying brand for this portfolio of products. To align with this change, Azure AD is now Microsoft Entra ID.
    
    Today, the Microsoft Entra product family includes:
    
    - Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory)
    - Microsoft Entra ID Governance
    - Microsoft Entra External ID (Azure AD External Identities)
    - Microsoft Entra Permissions Management
    - Microsoft Entra Verified ID
    - Microsoft Entra Workload ID
    - Microsoft Entra Internet Access
    - Microsoft Entra Private Access
    
- ### Is Microsoft Entra a product?
    
    Microsoft Entra is a comprehensive family of identity and network access products.
    
- ### How does Azure AD relate to Microsoft Entra?
    
    Azure AD is now Microsoft Entra ID. It’s the foundational product of the Microsoft Entra product family.
    
    [Learn more](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id)
    
- ### How can I buy Microsoft Entra?

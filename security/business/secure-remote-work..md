## Get single sign-on and multifactor authentication with Microsoft Entra ID

Enable secure remote work by connecting all your cloud apps. Use unlimited single sign-on (SSO) and multifactor authentication (MFA) at no extra cost with Microsoft Entra ID.

## Connect to your apps

### Set up remote access to apps

Establishing identity management in the cloud is your first step. Microsoft Entra ID lets you manage authentication across devices, cloud apps, and on-premises apps. With single sign-on, your employees can access resources from any device while working remotely.

[Connect your apps with Microsoft Entra ID](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id)

### Enable remote access to on-premises web apps

Your business-critical apps may not be set up for access from outside the corporate network. Use Microsoft Entra ID application proxy, a lightweight agent, to enable access to your on-premises apps without opening up broad access to your network. Combine it with existing Microsoft Entra authentication and Microsoft Entra conditional access policies to help keep users and data secured.

### Collaborate with contractors and partners

Partnering with other organizations becomes more challenging without in-person meetings. Create and maintain relationships no matter where you are by removing barriers to remote interaction. Grant access to the right apps with a single sign-on experience. Ensure appropriate access to your organization’s resources anytime, anywhere, by applying a greater level of security and governance for partners.

## Protect access from anywhere

Multifactor authentication (MFA) is the single best thing you can do to improve security for remote work. If you’re not able to distribute hardware security devices, use biometrics or mobile device authentication apps, such as Microsoft Authenticator, as the second factor.

.heading-bg-color-layout-container-uid6190{ background-color: !important; }

## Extend protection to devices

Many organizations are increasing the use of personal devices to enable remote work. Microsoft Entra conditional access policies and Microsoft Intune app protection policies help manage and secure corporate data in approved apps on personal devices.

### Manage devices from the cloud

Microsoft Intune lets you manage both company-owned and employee-owned devices from the cloud. It allows you to manage across devices (laptop, tablet, and mobile device) and operating systems (iOS, Windows, and Android). Set up your Intune subscription then add users and groups of users, assign licenses, deploy and protect apps, and set up device enrollment.

### Create conditional access policies

Create conditional access policies according to user, device, application, and risk. Enforce controls that allow a device to access a specific resource only if it’s compliant.

## Strengthen Protection against threats

 

### Help protect against phishing

Phishing is a primary point of entry for attackers, and recent world events have provided them with a new opportunity to trick users into clicking on lures. Set up antiphishing protections with Microsoft Defender for Office 365 to increase security against malicious emails and help protect your employees from increasingly sophisticated attacks.

### Protect endpoints

The Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integrated suite of pre- and post-breach protection capabilities helps your security team protect your environment and scale and operate efficiently while being remote. Take advantage of threat and vulnerability management, attack surface reduction, and auto investigation and remediation today. These features require relatively low effort to leverage and can have the greatest impact in helping to drive better security and improved efficiencies.

## Protect and govern your remote work

### Control and manage use of cloud apps and resources

Remote workers often need access to a variety of business-critical cloud apps to do their jobs. Use Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps to monitor session risk, gain visibility into usage, and enforce app and file usage policies in real time. Maintain productivity by educating and guiding workers to access the cloud resources they need through more secure methods.

### Strengthen your security posture using intelligent insights and guidance

Once you’ve deployed your security infrastructure, ensure you’re taking full advantage of its capabilities with an optimized configuration. Identify potential posture improvements and develop and implement a plan to get the most security out of your Microsoft 365 and Azure workloads with Microsoft Secure Score.

### Why multifactor authentication is a priority

Dealing with passwords is challenging for many companies. Breaches happen if passwords aren’t augmented or replaced with stronger authentication methods that are easily adopted by users. Learn why passwords don’t protect you from most attacks (but MFA does) and how to find the right options for your company and your users. We’ll also share how Microsoft can help you start eliminating passwords in your environment.

## How does Verified ID work?

Based on open standards, Verified ID is a managed verifiable credential service to issue and verify credentials for trustworthy, secure, and efficient digital interactions.

[Learn more](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2276754&clcid=0x409&culture=en-us&country=us)

![An infographic explaining three steps of digital credential verification: issue, store, and present](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/image/microsoftcorp/media-block-infographic-327472-1?resMode=sharp2&op_usm=1.5,0.65,15,0&wid=1100&hei=633&qlt=100&fit=constrain)

This diagram illustrates the process of how someone uses Verified ID to quickly and securely verify their identity.  
  

- A trusted organization—like a government agency or previous employer—attests to a person’s identity, employment status, age, skill, or other identity-related claim. The organization gives the person a verifiable credential that validates their claim.
- After receiving their new credential, the person stores it in their digital wallet.
- That person can present their credential whenever other organizations—like a prospective employer or airline—need to verify claims about their identity. 

The diagram also covers some of the benefits of adopting Verified ID. Using Verified ID strengthens identity protection, reduces costs, saves time, improves auditability, mitigates privacy risks, and empowers developers to build confidently on an open standards platform.

Frequently asked questions

- 01/
    
    ### What is Microsoft Entra Verified ID
    
    Microsoft Entra Verified ID is a managed verifiable credential service that enables organizations to build unique user-owned identity scenarios designed for trustworthy, secure, and efficient interactions between people and organizations.
    
- 02/
    
    ### Is Verified ID based on open standards?
    
    Yes, Verified ID is based on open standards, which are guidelines made available to the public that facilitate interoperability among different decentralized identity products. Microsoft collaborates with the wider identity community to create these open standards and incorporates them into Verified ID to ensure that it works universally. Learn more about open standards in [Verified ID documentation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2277305).
    
- 03/
    
    ### What is Face Check with Microsoft Entra Verified ID?
    
    Face Check is a privacy-respecting facial-matching feature that uses Azure AI services to provide high-assurance identity verification at scale. It is a premium feature within Microsoft Entra Verified ID.
    
- 04/
    
    ### How does Face Check work?
    
    Face Check compares a person’s real-time selfie with the picture associated with their account, which is usually from a trusted identity document, such as a driver’s license or employee ID. Face Check’s advanced algorithms will compare the two images to verify that both faces match, without storing the information or passing it to the verifier. This cloud-based, encrypted system protects the data, only revealing a percent confidence score that the faces match.
    
- 05/
    
    ### How is Face Check different from using facial recognition to unlock my phone or access an app?
    
    Both Face Check and the face-scanning security feature you may use to unlock your device require a user to face a camera, but they operate in different ways. Face Check compares the liveness data (selfie) with a photo on your Verified ID, usually from a trusted identity document such as a driver’s license or employee ID. This mechanism provides a crucial layer of trust, especially in high-assurance scenarios, such as accessing high-value business processes or sensitive company information. The face-scanning feature on your device may compare your live face to a representation of your face stored on the device.

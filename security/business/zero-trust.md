## Zero Trust that extends to your entire digital estate

Instead of assuming everything behind the corporate firewall is safe, the Zero Trust model assumes breach and verifies each request as though it originates from an open network. Every access request is fully authenticated, authorized, and encrypted before granting access.

![A diagram showing Policy Optimisation, Identities, Teru Trust Policy, App Endpoint, Infrastructure, and Threat Protection.](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/image/microsoftcorp/367541-infographic-1075x607?resMode=sharp2&op_usm=1.5,0.65,15,0&wid=1075&hei=608&qlt=100&fmt=png-alpha&fit=constrain)

A holistic approach to Zero Trust should extend to your entire digital estate—inclusive of identities, endpoints, network, data, apps, and infrastructure. Zero Trust architecture serves as a comprehensive end-to-end strategy and requires integration across the elements.

The foundation of Zero Trust security is identities. Both human and non-human identities need strong authorization, connecting from either personal or corporate endpoints with compliant devices, requesting access based on strong policies grounded in Zero Trust principles of explicit verification, least-privilege access, and assumed breach.

As a unified policy enforcement, the Zero Trust policy intercepts the request, explicitly verifies signals from all six foundational elements based on policy configuration, and enforces least-privilege access. Signals include the role of the user, location, device compliance, data sensitivity, and application sensitivity. In addition to telemetry and state information, the risk assessment from threat protection feeds into the policy engine to automatically respond to threats in real time. Policy is enforced at the time of access and continuously evaluated throughout the session.

This policy is further enhanced by policy optimization. Governance and compliance are critical to a strong Zero Trust implementation. Security posture assessment and productivity optimization are necessary to measure the telemetry throughout the services and systems.

Telemetry and analytics feed into the threat protection system. Large amounts of telemetry and analytics enriched by threat intelligence generate high-quality risk assessments that can be either manually investigated or automated. Attacks happen at cloud speed and, because humans can’t react quickly enough or sift through all the risks, your defense systems must also act at cloud speed. The risk assessment feeds into the policy engine for real-time automated threat protection and additional manual investigation if needed.

Traffic filtering and segmentation is applied to the evaluation and enforcement from the Zero Trust policy before access is granted to any public or private network.

Data classification, labeling, and encryption should be applied to emails, documents, and structured data. Access to apps should be adaptive, whether SaaS or on-premises. Runtime control is applied to infrastructure with serverless, containers, IaaS, PaaS, and internal sites with JIT and version controls actively engaged.

Finally, telemetry, analytics, and assessment from the network, data, apps, and infrastructure are fed back into the policy optimization and threat protection systems.

FAQ

- 01/
    
    ### What is Zero Trust?
    
    Zero Trust is a modern security strategy based on the principle never trust, always verify. Instead of assuming everything behind the corporate firewall is safe, the Zero Trust model assumes breach and verifies each request as though it originates from an open network.
    
- 02/
    
    ### What are the main pillars of Zero Trust?
    
    The three main pillars of Zero Trust are:  
      
    
    1. Verify explicitly: always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points, including user identity, location, device health, service or workload, data classification, and anomalies.
    2. Use least-privilege access: limit user access with just-in-time and just-enough-access, risk-based adaptive polices, and data protection to help secure data and improve productivity.
    3. Assume breach: verify end-to-end encryption and use analytics to gain visibility, detect threats, and improve defenses.
    
     
    
- 03/
    
    ### Why do organizations need Zero Trust solutions?
    
    Organizations need Zero Trust solutions because security has become more complex. As increasing numbers of employees work remotely, it’s no longer sufficient to just protect the network perimeter. Organizations need adaptive solutions that fully authenticate and verify every access request and quickly detect and respond to threats both inside and outside the network.
    
- 04/
    
    ### What problem does Zero Trust solve?
    
    Zero Trust helps solve the problem of greater complexity. Today’s organizations need to protect a growing volume of data across a multiplatform, multicloud environment. Risks to that data have increased as more companies turn to hybrid work and attacks become more sophisticated. Zero Trust helps simplify security with a strategy, processes, and automated tools that verify every transaction, enforce least-privilege access, and apply advanced detection and response to threats.
    
- 05/
    
    ### What is an example of Zero Trust network?
    
    A Zero Trust network fully authenticates, authorizes, and encrypts every access request, applies microsegmentation and least-privilege access principles to minimize lateral movement, and uses intelligence and analytics to detect and respond to anomalies in real time.
    
- 06/
    
    ### What is an example of Zero Trust policy?
    
    One of the most effective Zero Trust policies is multifactor authentication. Requiring that every user perform two or more forms of authentication (such as using a PIN on a known device) every time they sign in significantly decreases the risk that a bad actor with stolen credentials will gain access.
    
- 07/
    
    ### How do you implement a Zero Trust strategy?
    
    Implementing a Zero Trust strategy starts with identifying business priorities and gaining leadership buy-in. It may take many years to complete the rollout, so it helps to start with easy wins and prioritize tasks based on business goals. An implementation plan will typically include the following steps:  
     
    
    - Roll out identity and device protection, including multifactor authentication, least-privilege access, and conditional access policies.
    - Enroll endpoints in a device-management solution to ensure devices and apps are up to date and meet organizational requirements.
    - Deploy an extended detection and response solution to detect, investigate, and respond to threats across endpoints, identities, cloud apps, and emails.
    - Protect and govern sensitive data with solutions that provide visibility into all data and apply data loss prevention policies.

    ### What is the difference between Zero Trust and secure access service edge (SASE)?
    
    SASE is a security framework that combines software-defined wide area networking (SD-WAN) and Zero Trust security solutions into a converged cloud-delivered platform that securely connects users, systems, endpoints, and remote networks to apps and resources.  
      
    Zero Trust, which is a modern security strategy that centers on verifying each access request as though it originates from an open network, is one component of SASE. SASE also includes SD-WAN, Secure web gateway, cloud access security broker, and firewall as a service, all centrally managed through a single platform.

    ### What is the difference between Zero Trust and a virtual private network (VPN)?
    
    A VPN is a technology that enables remote employees to connect to the corporate network.  
      
    Zero Trust is a high-level strategy that assumes that individuals, devices, and services that are attempting to access company resources, even those inside the network, cannot automatically be trusted. To enhance security, these users are verified every time they request access, even if they were authenticated earlier.

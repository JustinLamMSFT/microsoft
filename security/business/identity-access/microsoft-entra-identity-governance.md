## Enhance productivity and security

Identity governance increases employee productivity and helps meet compliance and regulatory requirements.

### Improve productivity

Automate employee, supplier, and business partner access to apps and services—in the cloud and on premises—at enterprise scale. Help ensure that people have access when they require it—without the burden of manual approvals.

![](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/image/microsoftcorp/Blade005_Enhance_2_40x40_2x?resMode=sharp2&op_usm=1.5,0.65,15,0&wid=40&hei=40&qlt=100&fmt=png-alpha&fit=constrain) 

### Strengthen security

Reduce risk arising from access abuse and make smart access decisions based on machine learning. Set up requirements for recurring reviews to ensure that there is a continuing need for users, group memberships, and access.

![](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/image/microsoftcorp/Blade005_Enhance_3_40x40_2x?resMode=sharp2&op_usm=1.5,0.65,15,0&wid=40&hei=40&qlt=100&fmt=png-alpha&fit=constrain) 

### Simply powerful. Powerfully simple.

Streamline deployment and operation with a cloud-based product. Support both cloud and on-premises apps. Integrate Microsoft apps plus hundreds of non-Microsoft apps with ease.

### Automate routine tasks

Delegate day-to-day resource access requests to relevant business groups, and automate the approval process for customary resource access to help you focus on AI-provided insights and exceptions.

## Identity governance for employees and partners

### Automate the entire employee identity lifecycle

Design workflows to automatically create an identity via a signal from an HR system. Gracefully remove access when the employee leaves the organization.

![A person writing at their desk ](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/image/microsoftcorp/Blade008_HelpSafeguard_2_1048x584_1x?resMode=sharp2&op_usm=1.5,0.65,15,0&wid=786&hei=443&qlt=85&fit=constrain) 

### Assign employee access to resources

Automatically assign app and resource access based on employee group memberships. Ensure that conflicting access (with app administrators and app users, for example) can’t occur with separation of duties. Delegate access decisions to business groups.

![Two people having a conversation and looking at a laptop ](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/image/microsoftcorp/Blade008_HelpSafeguard_3_1048x584_1x?resMode=sharp2&op_usm=1.5,0.65,15,0&wid=786&hei=443&qlt=85&fit=constrain) 

### Allow guest and partner access to resources

Enable business groups to allow access to partners, suppliers, and guests securely via the same robust entitlement management and access review capabilities that employees use—with the same exception handling and rich reporting.

.heading-bg-color-layout-container-uid47ea{ background-color: !important; }

## Control identities and access

Automatically create user identities and roles in the apps users need to access, and maintain and remove user identities as status or roles change.

This diagram illustrates how Microsoft Entra ID can automatically create conditional, need-based user identities and roles for cloud-based software as a service (SaaS), on-premises, and virtual machine apps.

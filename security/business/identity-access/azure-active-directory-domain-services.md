OVERVIEW

## Save costs and operate more efficiently with managed domain services

Microsoft Entra Domain Services (formerly Azure Active Directory Domain Services), part of Microsoft Entra, enables you to use managed domain services—such as Windows Domain Join, group policy, LDAP, and Kerberos authentication—without having to deploy, manage, or patch domain controllers.

- ### 
    
    Increase operational efficiency
    
    Enable managed domain services for virtual machines and directory-aware applications deployed in Azure with a click of a button. Reduce operational and maintenance costs associated with managing identity infrastructure for your virtual machines and legacy applications.

- ### 
    
    Run legacy applications in the cloud
    
    Easily migrate on-premises apps to a managed domain. Streamline management of all applications from your legacy, directory-aware apps alongside your modern cloud apps with a single identity solution.
    
    ![A screenshot of a computer screen displaying contoso.com | Security settings.](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/image/microsoftcorp/386320-02-accordion-1920x1080?resMode=sharp2&op_usm=1.5,0.65,15,0&wid=1664&hei=1062&qlt=100&fit=constrain)
    
- ### 
    
    Rely on a highly available managed service
    
    Domain Services includes multiple domain controllers to provide high availability. Ensure business continuity with guaranteed service uptime and resilience to failures.
    
    ![A screenshot of a computer displaying a domain service interface for contoso.com.](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/image/microsoftcorp/386320-03-accordion-1920x1080?resMode=sharp2&op_usm=1.5,0.65,15,0&wid=1664&hei=1062&qlt=100&fit=constrain)
    
- ### 
    
    Unify your identity infrastructure management
    
    Simplify the experience of managing and securing your entire identity infrastructure, including Domain Services, with the Microsoft Entra admin center.

- **01/**
    
    ### How does Microsoft Entra Domain Services relate to Microsoft Entra?
    
    Domain Services is a part of Microsoft Entra, the Microsoft product family for multicloud identity and access solutions.
    
- **02/**
    
    ### Can I create multiple managed domains for a single Microsoft Entra tenant?
    
    No. You can create a single managed domain serviced by Microsoft Entra Domain Services for a single Microsoft Entra tenant.
    
- **03/**
    
    ### Can I enable Domain Services in an Azure Resource Manager virtual network?
    
    Yes. Domain Services can be enabled in an Azure Resource Manager virtual network. Classic Azure virtual networks are no longer available when you create a managed domain.
    
- **04/**
    
    ### Can guest users invited to my directory use Domain Services?
    
    No. Guest users invited to your Microsoft Entra tenant using the Microsoft Entra B2B invite process are synchronized to your Domain Services managed domain. However, as passwords for these users aren't stored in your Microsoft Entra tenant, Domain Services has no way to synchronize NTLM and Kerberos hashes for these users to your managed domain, so they can't sign in or join computers to the managed domain.
    
    [Learn more](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2298237&clcid=0x409)
    
- **05/**
    
    ### Does Domain Services include high availability options?
    
    <table style="min-width: 25.0px;"><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Yes. Each Domain Services managed domain includes two domain controllers. You don't manage or connect to these domain controllers—they're part of the managed service. If you deploy Domain Services into a region that supports availability zones, the domain controllers are distributed across zones. In regions that don't support availability zones, the domain controllers are distributed across availability sets.</td></tr></tbody></table>
    
    [Learn more](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2211384&clcid=0x409)
    
- **06/**
    
    ### How long does it take for changes I make to my Microsoft Entra tenant to be visible in my managed domain?
    
    Changes made in your Microsoft Entra tenant using either the Microsoft Entra admin center or PowerShell are automatically synchronized to your managed domain. This synchronization process runs in the background. There's no defined time period for this synchronization to complete all the object changes.
    
- **07/**
    
    ### Can I pause a Domain Services managed domain?
    
    No. Once you've enabled a Domain Services managed domain, the service is available within your selected virtual network until you delete the managed domain. There's no way to pause the service. Billing continues on an hourly basis until you delete the managed domain.

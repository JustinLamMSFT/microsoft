## Frequently asked questions

Expand all | Collapse all

- ### What is cloud configuration?
    
    Simply put, cloud configuration is a Microsoft-recommended device configuration for Windows 10 and Windows 11, cloud-optimized for users with specific workflow needs. IT admins use Microsoft Intune to apply a standard, cloud-based, easy-to-manage configuration of Windows 10 and Windows 11 to a selected set of new or existing devices. The configuration works on devices running Windows 10 or Windows 11 Pro or Windows 10 or Windows 11 Enterprise and may be appropriate for workers who only need a limited number of IT-curated and approved apps to meet their targeted workflow needs. User accounts are registered in Microsoft Entra ID and devices are enrolled for cloud management in Intune, so they’re automatically updated with continuous product and security updates.
    
- ### Is this a new product or feature?
    
    No. Cloud configuration is not a new version, edition, or mode of Windows, so it does not depend on new hardware, and there are no operating system restrictions. In short, cloud configuration is a standardized, easy-to-manage configuration that can be applied to PCs running Windows 10 or Windows 11 Pro, Windows 10 or Windows 11 Enterprise, or Windows 10 or Windows 11 Education. It is deployed using Microsoft Intune.
    
- ### Does cloud configuration require a special version of Windows?
    
    Any supported semiannual channel version of Windows 10 or Windows 11 Pro, Windows 10 or Windows 11 Enterprise, or Windows 10 or Windows 11 Education can be used. See the [overview and setup guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2236556) for details.
    
- ### What scenarios does cloud configuration support?
    
    Cloud configuration may be appropriate for anyone who can perform their role with some combination of browser, Microsoft Teams, email, optional productivity apps, and a limited number of internal line-of-business apps delivered directly to the device or through desktop or app virtualization. This standardized configuration can be used for many different scenarios such as standardizing device configuration across departments, enabling remote work with virtualization and a simple device configuration, or empowering students and teachers.
    
- ### Do I need to pay extra to use cloud configuration?
    
    Cloud configuration is ready to go today and can be deployed to any devices for which you have a valid Windows 10 or Windows 11 Pro, Windows 10 or Windows 11 Enterprise, or Windows 10 or Windows 11 Education license. Cloud configuration can be applied, removed, and changed anytime using Microsoft Intune, similar to how Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices are managed today.
    
- ### How do I deploy the recommended configuration?
    
    Use the guided scenario available from the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2236664) or apply the configuration yourself manually using the steps recommended in the overview and setup guide.

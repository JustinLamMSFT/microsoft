## Design floor plans simply, share them easily

  

Easily create professional-looking floor plans and blueprints with Microsoft Visio.

    ### Plan ahead with a digital floor plan
    
    Simplify the design process by creating a visualization of your ideal space before work begins. Start with a premade floor plan template, then add doors, windows, electrical outlets, and other essential details—problem-solving and refining your design as you go.

    ### Collaborate with other stakeholders
    
    Share your designs with architects, designers, and contractors to get closer to making your vision a reality. Export files as a link, PDF, image, or computer-aided design (CAD) drawing—and resize, change scale, or save locked layers to prevent unwanted changes.

    ### Perfect your floor plan as you go
    
    Coauthor and coedit your floor plan by capturing real-time feedback from collaborators. Save multiple versions of the same file and store layers for easy comparison. Or, if you need to work fast, work collaboratively on a drawing at the same time.

    ### Add resources to create context
    
    Include all the necessary information by linking any shape in your floor plan layout to an Excel spreadsheet or other documentation. Or combine Power BI with Visio to build charts and dashboards that can help you understand complex data sets, align with KPI measures, and track your goals.

### Simple, easy-to-use program

To get the best results, you need a floor plan creator that is intuitive and simple to use—whether you’re a professional or a do-it-yourself expert. Look for a user-friendly program that comes with built-in templates and makes it easy to resize, rescale, and revise your design.

![An employee and customer in a furniture store looking at a video wall displaying product information](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/image/microsoftcorp/Blade007_Vertical-Tabs_1-Up_1194x670_Desktop_b_2X?resMode=sharp2&op_usm=1.5,0.65,15,0&wid=800&qlt=100&fit=constrain) 

### Broad selection of shapes and symbols

The best floor plans accurately depict what the finished space will look like. Choose a program that provides a broad selection of shapes and symbols, so you can document all the important details in one place—from the location of electrical outlets to where you’ll place your sofa.

### Made for sharing and collaboration

Because architectural design is so collaborative, it is important that the tool you choose be cross-functional. Look for a floor plan creator that allows you to export files as a link, PDF, image, or computer-aided design (CAD) drawing—and gives you the flexibility to lock layers as necessary.

## How the Microsoft Visio floor plan creator works

A floor plan is a graphic representation of a blueprint. The purpose of a floor plan is to visualize what a space will look like once it’s complete.

Beginning your project with a well-designed floor plan—complete with HVAC elements, electrical symbols, and other technical details—makes it easier to solve layout issues, collaborate with builders and interior designers, and align with stakeholders before everything is set in stone.

Microsoft Visio is a diagraming tool that makes it easy to create floor plans, engineering designs, and more. To begin, choose a floor plan template that meets your needs, then lay out and scale objects to your liking.

## Floor plan examples and other diagrams

Microsoft Visio comes with dozens of templates to help you create blueprints and floor plans for any project—big or small, residential or commercial.

![A person working at their desk across two screens](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/image/microsoftcorp/Blade0010_Content%20Card%20-%20VP5%20Desktop%20-%203%20Up%20-%20No%20Depth_524x292_Desktop_a_2X?resMode=sharp2&op_usm=1.5,0.65,15,0&wid=786&hei=443&qlt=100&fmt=png-alpha&fit=constrain) 

### Office layouts

A professional floor plan can shorten the timeline for building plan development from weeks to minutes. The **Office Layout** template in Visio provides a visual overview of an office space, complete with shapes for office accessories, office equipment, office furniture, walls, doors, windows, and more. This template can be used to customize single offices or diagram several office spaces at once.

### HVAC diagrams

Visio has three templates for creating HVAC diagrams and drawings—the **HVAC Plan**, the **HVAC Control Logic**, and the **Reflected Ceiling Plan**. These templates can be used to create annotated diagrams for heating, ventilation, air conditioning and distribution, and refrigeration systems for automated building control, environmental control, and energy systems. And they’re totally customizable.

## Frequently asked questions

Expand all | Collapse all

- ### How long can I use the trial version of Visio?
    
    Trial versions only exist for Visio Plan 1 and Visio Plan 2. These trials are free for 30 days for **first-time trial users** with a work or school account. To sign up for your 30-day trial, visit the following links for [Visio Plan 1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=857643) and [Visio Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=403841). Visio Plan 1 provides access to Visio for the web. Visio Plan 2 provides access to both Visio for the web and Visio desktop. There are no trial versions of Visio Standard or Visio Professional.
    
- ### Which Microsoft 365 commercial plans include the Visio web app?
    
    Following is a complete list of the Microsoft 365 commercial plans that include the Visio web app: Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Microsoft 365 Business Standard, Microsoft 365 Business Premium, Microsoft 365 Apps for business, Office 365 E1, Office 365 E3, Office 365 E5, Office 365 F3, Microsoft 365 F3, Microsoft 365 E3, Microsoft 365 E5, Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, Office 365 A1, Office 365 A3, Office 365 A5, Microsoft 365 A1, Microsoft 365 A3, and Microsoft 365 A5.
    
    Please note, small and medium business plans—such as Business Basic and Business Standard with a Microsoft account ID (hotmail.com, outlook.com, live.com, msn.com)—will not have access to the Visio web app, as these plans do not qualify as commercial plans.
    
- ### I’m trying to install a 32-bit version of Visio, but I’m running a 64-bit version of Office. How do I resolve this?
    
    You cannot mix 32- and 64-bit versions of Microsoft solutions. To resolve this, you will need to uninstall your current 64-bit version of Office and install the 32-bit version instead. Please refer to [this support page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2158029) for further instructions.
    
- ### I have one of the newest versions of Office but want to keep my old version of Visio. How can I do that?
    
    Running different versions of Office and Visio depends on the installation technology used to install the products. For compatibility, the rule is:
    
    - You cannot install two products together that have the same version but use different installation technologies.
    - You cannot install two products of different versions together if both products use Click-to-Run as the installation technology and those products have overlapping Office applications.
    
    Please refer to [this support page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2235844) for more compatibility details and [this support page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2235661) for volume licensing installation.
    
- ### How do I transfer my existing copy of Visio to a new computer?
    
    For a non-subscription version (Visio Standard or Visio Professional), use the same product key you used for your existing app to download Visio onto your new machine. Sign in with an existing Microsoft account and enter your product key at [microsoft365.com/setup](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2214056). Redeeming your key links your account with the Visio app. Once you’ve completed the aforementioned steps, follow [these steps](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2158128) to download Visio. For more details about installing Visio, please visit [this support page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2158129).
    
    For Visio Plan 1 or Visio Plan 2, please visit [this support page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2158240) for installation instructions.
    
- ### Does the OneDrive for work or school storage that comes with a Visio for the web plan override my existing OneDrive for work or school subscription?
    
    Both Visio Plan 1 and Visio Plan 2 come with 2 GB of storage on OneDrive for work or school. If you don't currently have a OneDrive for work or school subscription, you'll receive 2 GB of storage with your subscription plan. If you do have an existing OneDrive for work or school subscription, the 2 GB of storage included in a Visio for the web plan does not add to your existing storage capacity nor does it override your current OneDrive for work or school subscription.
    
- ### Which older versions of Visio can run on Windows 11? How can I transition from my older version of Visio to a newer version without compromising my old version files?
    
    All currently supported versions of Visio will run on Windows 11. This includes both Visio plans and the 2013, 2016, and 2019 non-subscription versions of Visio. Your old Visio files will not be compromised when you upgrade to a newer version of Visio; your files will work as expected in the new version. However, Visio automatically blocks opening any pre-2013 Visio file. To resolve this, please visit [this support page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2235846).
    
- ### Does the current version of Microsoft Visio support older versions, like Visio 2003? If we create a diagram in the current version, can we open it with an older version and vice versa?
    
    Yes, the current version of Visio is compatible with older versions. Yes, you can open files created in the current version with an older version and vice versa. Please note, the current version (by default) saves drawings as a .vsdx file. Whereas the 2003 version saves them as a .vsd file, so you will need to save your drawing as a .vsd file to open it in an older version of Visio.
    
- ### How do I protect my Visio files?
    
    Current versions of Visio offer Information Rights Management (IRM) features. In non-subscription versions of Visio, go to **File** > **Info** > **Protect Diagram** > **Restrict Access**.
    
    You can’t set IRM from within Visio for the web, but Visio for the web honors whatever access rights have been set for a file in the desktop Visio app once the file is stored online. For additional details on IRM in Visio, please visit [this support page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2236200).
    
- ### What data sources can I link my diagrams to?
    
    Data linking is only available through the Visio desktop app, but in Visio for the web, you can **view** data-linked diagrams.
    
    - Visio currently supports multiple data sources, including:
    - Microsoft Excel workbooks
    - Microsoft Access databases
    - Microsoft SharePoint Foundation lists
    - Microsoft SQL Server databases
    - Microsoft Exchange Server directories
    - Azure Active Directory information
    - Other OLEDB or ODBC data sources

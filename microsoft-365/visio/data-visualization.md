## Why data visualization is important

Data visualization helps people process large amounts of data by displaying it in a visual format the human brain can quickly comprehend.

.heading-bg-color-layout-container-uid38fa{ background-color: !important; }

- ![](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/image/microsoftcorp/Blade003_Horizontal_Content_111x111_x2_a?resMode=sharp2&op_usm=1.5,0.65,15,0&wid=111&hei=111&qlt=100&fmt=png-alpha&fit=constrain)
    
    ### Make sense of big data
    
    In the age of big data, processing trillions of data points at a time isn’t unusual. Data visualization helps highlight what’s most important by removing the noise in a dataset and distilling it into a format that’s easier to understand. 
    
    Data visualization is an essential part of the data science process, which states that after data has been collected, processed, and modeled, it must be made visual for conclusions to be drawn. Without these visualizations, big data is just too massive to be immediately useful.

    ### Find and share useful insights
    
    Data visualization is an excellent way to find and share helpful insights. Some people use data visualization to spur idea generation or problem solve—others rely on this method to discover patterns and communicate complex data relationships.
    
    This works because the human brain is naturally drawn to colors and patterns. For example, we can easily distinguish between red and green—or triangle and circle. Data scientists take advantage of this instinct and use it to help us recognize what’s actually important in the data.

    ### Make informed decisions faster
    
    Decision makers in every industry—from government and finance to consumer goods and education—rely on great data to inform their next steps. To stay ahead of the curve, decision makers need to get tangible information in a format they can understand as quickly as possible.
    
    Data visualization helps data analysts, data scientists, and other professionals display data to decision makers in a consumable format—empowering them to move quickly from understanding to action.

    ### Align with reality
    
    Data visualization is visual storytelling—and a crucial step in data science. Not only does it help analysts convey data more clearly, but it also enables people to align with reality and achieve success with less mistakes.
    
    People in every profession can benefit from data visualization. A medical professor might use it to reveal hidden causes of heart disease—or a movie analyst might use it to plot how films perform in the Bechdel Test. The insights are endless.

### Inventory monitoring diagram in Microsoft Visio

Visualizations are often used by businesses to track the flow of goods. This diagram—created in Microsoft Visio and pulling live data from Power BI—compares stock and sales data for a retailer and displays it directly on images of individual clothing racks. This makes it easy for employees, both on the showroom floor and in the back office, to ensure customers can always find what they’re looking for.

### Facility monitoring diagram in Microsoft Visio

Data visualizations are as diverse as the data they represent. This diagram—created with Power BI and Microsoft Visio—displays the expected temperature across the second floor of an office building alongside the temperature data that was actually observed. In this visualization, users can use the Pan & Zoom function in Visio to explore specific office spaces or drill even deeper into the data.

### Business process monitoring diagram in Microsoft Visio

Organizations that track a wide variety of metrics can benefit from displaying that data visually. This example of a loan approval process—built in Microsoft Visio, using standard Power BI visuals—compares expected and actual ticket service level agreements in hours. It also shows the people, financial resources, and equipment allocated to each step.

### Organizational performance diagram in Microsoft Visio

Sometimes all you need is a visual snapshot to understand what’s going on. These examples show a Microsoft Visio organization chart alongside a Power BI dashboard displaying revenue per month by product and the revenue percentage variance in relation to budget. This visual helps quickly capture the big picture for decision makers and adjusts to changes in either data set.

## Frequently asked questions

Expand all | Collapse all

- ### What is the main goal of data visualization?
    
    The primary goal of data visualization is to make data more understandable. The most effective visualizations tell a story, allowing insights that would otherwise be buried in the dataset to come through.
    
- ### What software is used for data visualization?
    
    There are numerous data visualization software options available to professionals. [Microsoft Visio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/visio/data-visualization) is a popular option for creating and sharing data-linked diagrams.
    
- ### How is data visualization used?
    
    Data visualization is used by professionals in a wide range of industries to tell powerful data stories and make sense of large amounts of information. In fact, the method has been used for centuries to do just this.
    
    From public health visualizations to pop music analysis, data visualization has an important part to play in interpreting complicated data for a broader audience. 
    
- ### What are some advantages of data visualization?
    
    Data visualization is the best technique human beings have for making sense of large datasets. The human brain evolved to spot patterns, make visual distinctions, and understand the world through narratives, which is why data visualization is so effective.
    
    Data visualization has many advantages over delivery of raw data:
    
    - **Visuals are easier to understand.** The human brain is programmed for visual communication. Data visualization presents raw data in a clear and cohesive way, which makes it easier to draw informed conclusions and see things from a high-level perspective.
    - **Visualized content is processed faster.** Human beings process visual images like graphs and charts much faster than text. Data visualization dramatically improves the speed of decision-making.
    - **Data stories are more engaging.** Data visualization allows data scientists and other professionals to create a narrative from raw inputs. While some draw a line between creative storytelling and technical analysis, data science merges the two for greater effect.
    
- ### What is the difference between data visualization and data analysis?
    
    Data analysis is the process of collecting, cleaning, and analyzing data to find data-based insights. Data analysis is important because it gives decision makers tangible information they can use to inform their strategy.
    
    The next step is data visualization, which makes this data visually consumable for a broader audience. Data visualization has the power to tell data-driven stories while empowering people to see patterns or connections they wouldn’t otherwise notice.
    
    Both data analysis and data visualization are elements of the larger discipline of data science. When used in harmony, they can help professionals make informed decisions, increase their understanding of data-related topics, and even predict future events.

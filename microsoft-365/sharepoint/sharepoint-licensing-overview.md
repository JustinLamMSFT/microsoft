.heading-bg-color-layout-container-uidce3e{ background-color: !important; }

  
SharePoint supports intranet, extranet, and Internet applications from a single, integrated platform. The specific licenses you need depend on three factors: what capabilities are used, how SharePoint is deployed, and where the system is hosted. The terms and conditions for how you can use the software are defined in the [Product Terms](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=509893) document.  

- **SharePoint Online** is licensed on a per-user basis. You can purchase SharePoint Online as a standalone plan or included as part of Microsoft 365 plans. [Learn more](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/sharepoint/compare-sharepoint-plans). Licensing details are available [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=513845).  
    
- **For On-Premises**, intranet sites are licensed using a Server/CAL (Client Access License) model. SharePoint Server 2019 is required for each running instance of the software, and CALs are required for each person or device accessing a SharePoint Server.

**Notes**

- SharePoint Enterprise CAL is additive: to access the Enterprise edition features of SharePoint, a person/device must have both the SharePoint Standard CAL and the SharePoint Enterprise CAL.  
    
- In SharePoint 2019, for extranet and Internet sites scenarios, no CALs are required for external users.  
    - External users means users that are not either your or your affiliates’ employees, or your or your affiliates’ onsite contractors or onsite agents.  
        
    - SharePoint 2013 customers with Software Assurance (SA) can leverage Volume Licensing downgrade rights to run SharePoint 2013 bits with SharePoint 2019 use rights.

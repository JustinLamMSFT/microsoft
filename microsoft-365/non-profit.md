## Security, compliance, and privacy

Protecting sensitive data is imperative for the protection of your staff and programs—and for the success of your organization. Compromised data, and cyberattacks can put beneficiaries at risk, disrupt operations, and expose your organization to liability. Microsoft 365 provides a holistic approach to security—from protecting at the point of entry, to protecting your data anywhere, to detecting and remediating attacks.

## Frequently asked questions

### Top questions

Expand all | Collapse all

- #### Can I switch to other Office 365 plans?
    
    Yes. If you need to upgrade, you can transition your account to a different plan. For example, you can upgrade from an Office 365 E3 plan to an Office 365 E5 plan.
    
    In most cases, you can use the switch plans wizard in your admin center to upgrade your plan. If your subscription has more than 300 users or if you used a prepaid card to purchase your plan, the switch plans wizard is not available. Plans that are not eligible for the switch plans wizard can be upgraded manually. Learn more about [upgrading Office 365 plans](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2284816).
    
    NOTE: When you upgrade your account, your domain name is transferred to your new account, whether you brought your own domain name to the Microsoft 365 account or you set up a domain name with Microsoft 365.
    
- #### Can I cancel my subscription at any time?
    
    You can cancel your subscription at any time. For annual commitment subscriptions, such as Office 365 E5, there is a penalty for canceling before the end of your contract. Read the complete [Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=403930).
    
- #### What happens to my data if I cancel my subscription?
    
    Your data is yours. If you decide to cancel your Office 365 subscription, you can download your data—for example, your email and documents on team sites—and save it to another location. You should save your data before you cancel. After you cancel your subscription, data associated with your Microsoft 365 account will be available to your administrator(s) in a limited function account for 90 days.
    
- #### Will my trial information be transferred to my Office 365 subscription?
    
    Yes. If you purchase an Office 365 subscription with the same number of user accounts you created by the end of your free trial, the information and configuration for these users' accounts will remain intact. Once your free trial expires, you won't be able to continue using Office 365 for free. You will have an additional 30 days to purchase Office 365 before your account information is deleted. Once your trial account information has been deleted, it cannot be retrieved.
    
- #### Is internet access required for Office 365?
    
    Internet access is required to install and activate all Office 365 plans and to manage your subscription account. Internet connectivity is also required to access Microsoft 365 cloud productivity services, including email, conferencing, IT management, and other services.<sup><a aria-label="Footnote 6" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/office-365-e5?activetab=pivot:overviewtab#footnote6" class="ms-rte-link">6</a></sup>  
    
    Many Office 365 plans also include the desktop version of Microsoft 365, for example, Office 365 E5 and Office 365 E3. One of the benefits of having the desktop version of Microsoft 365 apps is that you can work offline and have the confidence that the next time you connect to the internet all your work will automatically sync, so you never have to worry about your documents being up to date. Your desktop version of Microsoft 365 is also automatically kept up to date and upgraded when you connect to the internet, so you always have the latest tools to help you work. [Compare Office 365 plans](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/compare-office-365-plans).
    
- #### What if I already own a domain name?
    
    You can add the domain name you own to Microsoft 365 to create domain-based email addresses. [Find your domain registrar or DNS hosting provider](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=403931). Or learn more about [adding custom or multiple domains](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=734748).
    
- #### I will need extra help setting up my Office 365 subscription. Who can help?

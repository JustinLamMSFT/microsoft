Expand all | Collapse all

- ### What forms of payment can I use?
    
    You can pay with all major credit cards, and your subscription amount will appear on your credit card statement. You also have the option to receive an invoice and, depending on your choice of services, you will be billed monthly or annually. You receive an email message when your invoice is ready to be viewed and, if a purchase order (PO) number is entered when you buy your subscription, that number will be included in your invoice.
    
- ### What payment options are available? Can I pay monthly or annually?
    
    Annual commitment payment is available for Office 365 Enterprise plans. With annual commitment, you sign up for a one-year subscription, but you can choose to pay month to month or pay for the entire year at the time you sign up.
    
- ### Do you offer volume discounts to businesses?
    
    Yes, discounts are available for Enterprise Agreement customers who want to purchase through volume licensing. A Microsoft partner can help you explore the purchasing options for large enterprises and help you determine which is best for you. Learn more about [volume licensing](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=403935). Find a [Microsoft partner](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=389781).
    
- ### Can I cancel my subscription at any time?
    
    You can cancel your subscription at any time. For annual commitment subscriptions, such as Office 365 E3, there is a penalty for cancelling before the end of your contract. Read the complete [Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=403930).
    
- ### What happens to my data if I cancel my subscription?
    
    Your data is yours. If you decide to cancel your Office 365 subscription, you can download your data—for example, your email and documents on team sites—and save it to another location. You should save your data before you cancel. After you cancel your subscription, data associated with your Microsoft 365 account will be available to your administrator(s) in a limited function account for 90 days.
    
- ### Can I switch to other Office 365 plans?
    
    Yes. If you need to upgrade, you can transition your account to a different plan. For example, you can upgrade from a Microsoft 365 Apps for business plan to an Office 365 Enterprise plan.
    
    In most cases, you can use the Switch plans wizard in your Admin center to upgrade your plan. If your subscription has more than 300 users or if you used a prepaid card to purchase your plan, the Switch plans wizard is not available. Plans that are not eligible for the Switch plans wizard can be upgraded manually. Learn more about [upgrading Office 365 plans](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=402442). 
    
    NOTE: When you upgrade your account, your domain name is transferred to your new account, whether you brought your own domain name to the Microsoft 365 account or you set up a domain name with Microsoft 365.
    
- ### Can I mix and match different Office 365 plans?
    
    Yes, you can mix and match Office 365 plans. There are some license limitations at the plan level. The Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Apps for business, Business Standard, and Business Premium plans have a collective limit of 300 users, while the Enterprise plans are for an unlimited number of users. For example, you can purchase 200 Business Premium seats, 100 Business Standard seats, and 500 Enterprise E3 seats on a single tenant.
    
- ### Will my trial information be transferred to my Office 365 subscription?
    
    Yes. If you purchase an Office 365 subscription with the same number of user accounts you created by the end of your free trial, the information and configuration for these users' accounts will remain intact. Once your free trial expires, you won't be able to continue using Office 365 for free. You will have an additional 30 days to purchase Office 365 before your account information is erased. Once your trial account information has been erased, it cannot be retrieved.
    
- ### I will need extra help setting up my Office 365 subscription. Who can help?
    
    Microsoft partners are trained IT and development companies that can help you move to Office 365 or develop custom solutions for your business. [Find a Microsoft partner](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=389781).
    
- ### What if I already own a domain name?
    
    You can add the domain name you own to Microsoft 365 to create domain-based email addresses. [Find your domain registrar or DNS hosting provider](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=403931). [Compare domain management in Office 365 subscriptions](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=403932).
    
- ### Is internet access required for Microsoft 365?
    
    Internet access is required to install and activate all Office 365 plans and to manage your subscription account. Internet connectivity is also required to access Microsoft 365 cloud productivity services, including email, conferencing, IT management, and other services. 
    
    Many Office 365 plans also include the desktop version of Microsoft 365, for example, Microsoft 365 Business Standard and Office 365 E3. One of the benefits of having the desktop version of Microsoft 365 apps is that you can work offline and have the confidence that the next time you connect to the internet all your work will automatically sync, so you never have to worry about your documents being up to date. Your desktop version of Microsoft 365 is also automatically kept up to date and upgraded when you connect to the internet, so you always have the latest tools to help you work.

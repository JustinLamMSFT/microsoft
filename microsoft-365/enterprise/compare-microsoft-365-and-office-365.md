## Frequently asked questions

Expand all | Collapse all

- ### What's the difference between Microsoft 365 and Office 365?
    
    The difference between Microsoft 365 and Office 365 is that Microsoft 365 is a cloud-based service that brings together best-in-class productivity apps with advanced device management, intelligent security, and innovative online services. Office 365 includes apps such as Outlook, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, along with services such as Exchange, OneDrive, and SharePoint.
    
- ### What’s included in Microsoft 365?
    
    Microsoft 365—which includes Microsoft 365 apps, Windows Enterprise, and Enterprise Mobility + Security—is more than just a licensing construct or a group of products. Microsoft 365 brings interconnectivity and intelligence that helps customers innovate and compete more effectively on their digital transformation journey.
    
- ### Are there free deployment resources available?
    
    Microsoft FastTrack is the customer success service that helps you move smoothly and confidently to Microsoft 365 and deliver business value faster. Customers with eligible subscriptions to Microsoft 365 can use FastTrack at no additional cost for the life of their subscription. Sign in to [Microsoft FastTrack](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/FastTrack) to request assistance and get started.
    
- ### Do you offer volume discounts to businesses?
    
    Discounts are available for Enterprise Agreement customers (typically more than 250 licenses) who want to purchase through volume licensing. A Microsoft partner can help you explore the purchasing options for large enterprises and help you determine which is best for you. Learn more about [volume licensing](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2244167). Find a [Microsoft partner](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2250820).
    
- ### How do I upgrade to another Microsoft 365 plan?
    
    Customers with Microsoft 365 E3 subscriptions, or a version of the suite that does not include Microsoft Teams, are eligible to purchase Microsoft 365 E5 Compliance and Microsoft 365 E5 Security as add-ons to their Microsoft 365 E3 subscriptions. Depending on the subscription level, customers can also combine their Microsoft 365 Enterprise subscriptions with plans and add-ons from Microsoft Entra ID, Dynamics 365, Enterprise Mobility + Security, and Microsoft 365.
    
- ### Can I have different types of Microsoft 365 plans within my organization?
    
    Yes, your organization can use any combination of plans as long as you meet plan prerequisites. Prerequisites vary by plan. Learn more and [compare Microsoft 365 plans](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft365-plans-and-pricing).
    
- ### What happens to my data if I cancel my subscription?
    
    Microsoft has a data retention period that is typically set to 90 days for most subscriptions. This period begins upon subscription cancellation. You may retrieve your data in this period even though your subscription is disabled.
    

.heading-bg-color-layout-container-uid8646{ background-color: !important; }

- \[1\] Once your paid subscription begins, cancellation policies vary based on your status as a new customer and your product and domain selections on Microsoft. [Learn more](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2184462). Cancel your Microsoft 365 subscription any time by going to the Microsoft 365 admin center. When a subscription is canceled, all associated data will be deleted. [Learn more about data retention, deletion, and destruction in Microsoft 365](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2187524).
- \[2\] After your one-month free trial ends, your subscription will automatically convert into a 12-month paid subscription and you will be charged the applicable subscription fee. Cancel anytime during your free trial to stop future charges. Credit card required to sign-up. [Learn more](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2248297).​

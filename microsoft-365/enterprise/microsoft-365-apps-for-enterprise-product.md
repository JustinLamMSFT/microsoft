## Frequently asked questions

- ### What is Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise?
    
    Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise is the always-up-to-date suite of desktop apps you already know (including Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Outlook, and Teams) available as a subscription. Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise includes exclusive intelligent capabilities like [Ideas in Excel](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2109915) and [Researcher in Word](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2109916), [real-time collaboration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2109917), Teams as the hub for teamwork, and advanced security features. As a user-based license, you can deploy Microsoft 365 on up to five PCs or Macs, five tablets, and five mobile devices. And with 1 TB of OneDrive cloud storage, you can access and collaborate on your files from anywhere.
    
- ### What is the difference between Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise and Office Professional Plus 2021?
    
    [Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-apps-for-enterprise), delivers the most productive and most secure Microsoft 365 experience—with the lowest total cost of ownership for deployment and management. However, for customers who can’t move all their devices to the cloud just yet due to inability to take regular updates, or have fully disconnected and secure environments, Office LTSC will be available. Office LTSC will be a one-time release version of Microsoft 365 apps, as with previous perpetual releases.
    
    The Microsoft 365 plans combine the familiar Microsoft 365 desktop suite of premium apps with cloud-based versions of Microsoft's next-generation communications and collaboration services—including Microsoft Exchange Online, Microsoft SharePoint Online, Microsoft 365 mobile, Microsoft 365 for the web, and Microsoft Teams—to help users be productive from virtually anywhere. [Learn more about service plans](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2171706).  
    
- ### What is the difference between Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise and Microsoft 365 Apps for business?
    
    Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise is built for enterprise customers. Along with always-up-to-date versions of the core Microsoft 365 desktop apps, it also includes enterprise-grade security and compliance features, enhanced communication tools, and fine-grained controls for deployment and management. Some small and medium-sized businesses, including those in regulated industries or wanting higher levels of IT control, may also be interested in Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise.

Microsoft 365 Apps for business is available for businesses with up to 300 users, whereas Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise is available for an unlimited number of users.
    
- ### What is the difference between Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise and Office 365 E1, E3, and E5?
    
    Microsoft 365 includes Microsoft 365 apps like Word and Excel, OneDrive cloud storage, and services like Teams, Exchange Online, and SharePoint Online. Different suites offer different combinations of these elements.
    
    - Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise offers Microsoft 365 desktop apps plus 1 TB of OneDrive cloud storage. These apps are always up to date, and new functionality can be added as often as monthly. It does not include services.
    - Office 365 E1 offers services only, plus web and mobile versions of the apps. Some customers buy E1 on its own, while others combine it with other versions of the Microsoft 365 apps.

- ### Do I need internet access to run Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise?
    
    A persistent internet connection is not required; Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise runs locally on your PC. Internet access is required to install and activate Microsoft 365, but IT administrators in traditional private cloud environments can deploy Microsoft 365 and Microsoft 365 updates using software distribution tools and infrastructure.
    
    Some features like Ideas in Excel and Researcher in Word require an internet connection. Regularly connecting to the internet ensures that you can receive automatic updates and that you’re using the latest versions of your Microsoft 365 apps. Internet access is also required to manage your Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise account, for example to change payment options or to access documents stored on OneDrive.
    
- ### Can people using older Microsoft 365 versions open documents I created using Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise?
    
    Yes, people using Office LTSC, Office 2019, 2016, 2013, 2010, and 2007 as well as Office for Mac 2008 or later will be able to open and view the documents you create.
    
- ### Do I have control over software updates if I use Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise?
    
    Yes, you can configure Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise to apply only the software updates you have tested and validated. You can manage software updates completely in-house either by using familiar software distribution tools or by directing Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise to check for updates at your file shares or URLs.
    
- ### Since Teams is now installed with Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, does it have the same update cadence?
    
    No, after Teams is installed, it's automatically updated approximately every two weeks with new features and quality updates. This update process for Teams is different than the update process for the other Microsoft 365 apps, such as Word and Excel. For more information, see [Teams update process](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2109683).

# Compare suites available through volume licensing

## Upgrade to the latest Office to boost productivity.

  

If you need to purchase five or more licenses, Microsoft offers **[Microsoft 365 Apps for business](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/business/microsoft-365-business-apps)** and [**Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-apps-for-enterprise-product).

Always-up-to-date with the latest version of Microsoft 365 Apps plus cloud services such as file sharing and storage, Microsoft 365 is a subscription service that enables you to work from virtually anywhere and includes productivity services you can deploy and manage the way you want. 

- For customers not yet ready for the cloud, Microsoft offers three suites through volume licensing—Office Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) Professional Plus 2021, Office LTSC Standard 2021, and Office LTSC Standard for Mac 2021.
    

If you need fewer than five licenses, please see the [**comparison page**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/business/compare-all-microsoft-365-business-products) for other Office suites.

Explore the different applications in the three Office suites available as a one-time purchase through volume licensing. The suites also differ in the level of integration with related business productivity servers.

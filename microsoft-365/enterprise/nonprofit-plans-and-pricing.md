## Frequently asked questions

Expand all | Collapse all

- ### What technology grants and discounts does Microsoft provide for nonprofits?
    
    Microsoft provides grants and discounts for eligible nonprofit organizations, including cloud services such as Microsoft 365, Azure and Dynamics 365, Surface hardware, on-premises software, and digital skilling. Please note that not every program may be available in every country.
    
- ### How do I apply for the Microsoft nonprofit programs available to my organization?
    
    First, review our [eligibility guidelines](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2195913) and then [get started](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2008962) by applying for a product grant or discount.
    
- ### How do I get help installing and using my Microsoft software?
    
    Microsoft encourages you to work with a partner in your country whose mission is to serve other nonprofits in building organization and technology capacity, such as nonprofit partners [TechSoup](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2127453) and [Tech Impact](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2127532).
    
- ### What are the eligibility requirements for the Microsoft nonprofit programs?
    
    Organizations must:
    
    - Hold recognized legal charitable status as defined in their countries, or be a public library or public museum.
    - Have a mission to benefit the broader community.
    - Attest to Microsoft's anti-discrimination policy.
    - Only assign licenses to eligible staff.
    - Only use the licenses for their organization and not license partner, affiliate, or sister organizations.
    
    Learn more about [eligibility](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2195913).
    
- ### If a library or library system is run by a city or county government (federal or state)—do they still get nonprofit pricing?
    
    Microsoft recognizes the critical role that public libraries and public museums play in society. These customers will be provided access to nonprofit pricing even if they do not hold recognized nonprofit legal status (equal to 501(c)(3) status under the United States Internal Revenue Code).
    
- ### How long does it take to receive eligibility validation?
    
    We strive to make eligibility determinations as quickly as possible, and the process can take up to 10 business days. This timeframe can vary depending on nonprofit responsiveness to requests for additional documentation and country requirements.
    
- ### Which persons affiliated with the nonprofit organization are eligible to receive donated or discounted user licenses?
    
    Nonprofit grants are permitted only for paid nonprofit employees, and unpaid executive staff who act as leadership for the nonprofit. Nonprofit discounts are permitted for all nonprofit staff and volunteers. Nonprofit program participants, members, and donors are NOT eligible for nonprofit licenses and subscriptions. Learn more about [eligibility](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2195913).

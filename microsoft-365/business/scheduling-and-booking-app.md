## Provide your clients flexibility, convenience, and control

Microsoft Bookings offers more options for your customers when they visit your booking page, book an appointment, or get a confirmation email and calendar invitation. Customers who book an appointment online can easily reschedule or cancel it themselves to keep everyone in sync. If you prefer to book appointments for your customers, enter the appointment details in Bookings so they receive confirmations and reminders. With Bookings, it’s also easy to track all changes made to appointments.

Overview

Easily schedule appointments with feature-rich tools

- ### 
    
    Simplify scheduling to save time
    
    Customize appointment details and booking requirements, and specify service providers to streamline the experience for you and your customers. Bookings works seamlessly with your Microsoft 365 calendar to help your customers quickly find available times and avoid double-booking. Spend less time scheduling and more time meeting with customers. Visit these sample pages to learn how to set appointments in Bookings.

- ### 
    
    ### Meet virtually with Microsoft Teams
    
    Make your Bookings meetings virtual with Teams. Every appointment booked as an online meeting creates a meeting link that everyone can join virtually from anywhere. Bookings is also available as an app within Teams to help you create calendars, assign staff, schedule new appointments, and meet without ever leaving Teams.

- ### 
    
    Customize appointments to your business needs
    
    Get flexibility and customization options to fit a variety of scheduling needs across departments, individuals, and types of appointments. Create and manage multiple Bookings calendars—each with their own unique setup. Different calendars can have different page structures, information, staff, and types of appointments and communication.
    
    ![A screenshot of a computer with the text Good Morning, Mary Beth.](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/image/microsoftcorp/5wr4a6ds-2-accordion-3-800x513?resMode=sharp2&op_usm=1.5,0.65,15,0&wid=1664&hei=1062&qlt=100&fmt=png-alpha&fit=constrain)
    
- ### 
    
    Provide your clients with flexibility, convenience, and control
    
    Give your customers more options when they visit your booking page, schedule an appointment, or get a confirmation email and calendar invitation. Customers who book an appointment online can easily reschedule or cancel it themselves to keep everyone in sync. If you prefer to book appointments for your customers, enter the appointment details in Bookings so they receive confirmations and reminders. You can even easily track all changes made to appointments.

## Frequently asked questions

Expand all

Collapse all

- **01/**
    
    ### What is a booking and scheduling app?
    
    A booking and scheduling app allows you to schedule customizable appointments. These apps often work seamlessly with your calendar and can help you and your clients avoid double-booking.
    
- **02/**
    
    ### Does Bookings work with other apps?
    
    Yes, Bookings works with other Microsoft apps, including Outlook and Teams. Bookings allows you to easily manage your appointments from your personal and professional calendars.
    
- **03/**
    
    ### What are the benefits of an online scheduling system?
    
    Online booking systems can save you and your business a lot of time and headaches that can come with trying to align schedules for appointments. An online scheduling tool makes it easy for people to see your calendar availability, even if they’re not in your organization. An online booking system can also prevent double-booking with real-time availability.
    
- **04/**
    
    ### What is the importance of scheduling meetings and planning ahead?
    
    Planning ahead to schedule meetings and appointments is important to ensure that you and the people you want to meet with are free. Scheduling meetings ahead of time also helps you prepare.
    
- **05/**
    
    ### What does it mean to be double-booked?
    
    Double-booking is when someone has more than one meeting or appointment at the same time. To avoid double-booking, use a scheduling or booking tool so that your availability is always up to date.
    
- **06/**
    
    ### What is a cancellation policy?
    
    A cancellation policy can protect you and your business from customers who cancel at the last minute, leaving you with an open appointment and potentially costing you money. A cancellation policy should be clear at the time of booking and not be a surprise to customers. Having a cancellation policy can help prevent people from cancelling at the last minute or not showing up at all.

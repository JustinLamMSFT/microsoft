    Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Business Standard, and Business Premium offer advanced tools and features specifically designed for businesses, including:
    
    - **Professional business email:** Create and use a branded email address with your business domain (e.g., yourname@yourbusiness.com).

For deeper integration and extensibility, businesses should purchase Microsoft 365 Copilot as an add-on, which connects directly to productivity apps and organizational data.
    
- ### How do I purchase Microsoft 365 Copilot?
    
    A separate license for [a qualifying Microsoft 365 plan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/copilot/business#FAQ) is required to purchase Microsoft 365 Copilot. If you have a qualifying plan already, you can manage and add Copilot to your subscription via the Microsoft 365 admin center. If you have questions about purchasing Copilot or any other Microsoft 365 subscription, [contact a product specialist](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2258601).
    
- ### What is the difference between Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Business Standard, Business Premium, and enterprise plan options?
    
    Microsoft has a variety of productivity and security management offerings for small to medium-sized businesses, each bringing increasingly powerful features and functionality.
    
    - Microsoft 365 Business Basic provides access to lightweight web and mobile versions of apps such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, as well as business email, cloud storage, and Microsoft Teams.
    - Microsoft 365 Business Standard combines powerful desktop, web, and mobile versions of apps like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, and additional apps such as Clipchamp, along with the same services as those in Business Basic. 
    - Microsoft 365 Business Premium includes all the same apps and services plus advanced cyberthreat protection and device management capabilities. 
    - Enterprise plan options offer increased levels of compliance and security management over business plans and provide additional business intelligence and analytics functionality. These plans are designed for enterprise customers and those with more than 300 users.
    
- ### If I’m already subscribed to a Microsoft 365 plan, can I switch to another plan?
    
    Yes, you can transition your account to a different plan as the needs of your organization change. [Learn how to try or buy a Microsoft 365 for business subscription](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2272261).
    
- ### Can I mix and match different Microsoft 365 plans?
    
    Our Microsoft 365 for business base plans (charged per user) are designed for organizations with up to 300 users. Organizations with more than 300 users should consider subscribing to Microsoft 365 for enterprise plans. We reserve the right to enforce a tenant limit of 300 provisioned licenses across the family of business plans, in which case we will provide advance notice and further guidance. In the meantime, we are treating customers that have provisioned up to 300 licenses of each individual business plan (Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Business Standard, Business Premium) as compliant with this 300-seat limit. This applies even if they have provisioned more than 300 total licenses across the family of business plans.
    
- ### Do you offer volume discounts?
    
    Discounts are available for enterprise agreement customers (typically 250+ licenses) who want to purchase through volume licensing. A Microsoft expert can help you explore the purchasing options for large organizations and help you determine which is best for you.
    
- ### Can I purchase Microsoft 365 add-on services to supplement my subscription?
    
    Many customers purchase a Microsoft 365 base subscription and then, depending on their needs, may choose to buy any number of add-on services to round out their implementation. Additionally, customers may choose to purchase apps from one of the thousands of vendors available in the Microsoft 365 store.
    
- ### Can I cancel my subscription at any time?
    
    You can cancel your subscription at any time. However, depending on the product and your subscription, there may be a penalty for canceling before the end of your contract. For subscriptions with a monthly commitment payment, there is no penalty for canceling your contract at any time. Annual commitment subscriptions paid month to month may incur some penalties if canceled early. Annual commitment subscriptions that are paid upfront do not receive a refund if canceled prior to the full contract period. Read the complete [Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=403930) for more details.
    
- ### What happens to my data if I cancel my subscription?
    
    Your data is yours. If you decide to cancel your Microsoft 365 subscription, you can download your data—for example, email and documents on team sites—and save it to another location. You should save your data before you cancel. After you cancel your subscription, data associated with your Microsoft 365 account will be available to your administrator(s) in a limited function account for 90 days.

For Microsoft 365 business plans, depending on your choice of service, you'll be billed monthly or annually.
    
- ### What's the difference between monthly, annual, and annual commitment payments?
    
    To provide you with the greatest amount of flexibility, different payment options are available.
    
    Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Microsoft 365 Apps for business, Microsoft 365 Business Standard, and Microsoft 365 Business Premium plans are available for monthly commitment payment or annual commitment payment.
    
    - **Monthly commitment payment:** Pay month by month and cancel at any time.
    - **Annual commitment payment:** Sign up for a one-year subscription and benefit from a discount for using this payment option. By default, your billing plan will be set to monthly billing. After your purchase, you can change your billing plan to annual billing within the Admin Portal.  
        The Microsoft 365 Enterprise and Office 365 Enterprise plans (including standalone plans such as Exchange Online) and Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise are available for annual commitment payment.
    
    - **Annual commitment payment:** Sign up for a one-year subscription and choose to pay monthly or for the entire year at the time you sign up.
    
- ### Can I convert my trial to a paid subscription and retain all my settings and files?
    
    Yes. If you purchase Microsoft 365 licenses for the accounts you create during your free trial, the information and configuration for these users' accounts will remain intact. Once your free trial expires, you’ll have an additional 30 days to purchase Microsoft 365 before your account information is erased. Once your trial account information has been erased, it can’t be retrieved.

    With OneDrive in Microsoft 365, get file storage that you can access when you’re offline. When you make changes while offline, they’ll be synced to OneDrive and across the rest of your devices when you reconnect.  
    
    With Outlook, read emails already delivered to your inbox, or draft new emails and meeting requests. Your inbox and outbox will sync across the rest of your devices when you reconnect.
    
- ### What happens to my data if I cancel my subscription?
    
    Your data is yours. If you decide to cancel your Microsoft 365 subscription, download your data—for example, your email and documents on team sites—and save it to another location. You should save your data before you cancel. After you cancel your subscription, data associated with your Microsoft 365 account will be available to your administrator(s) in a limited function account for 90 days.

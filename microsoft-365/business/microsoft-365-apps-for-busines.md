## Frequently asked questions

Expand all | Collapse all

- ### How many users does Microsoft 365 Apps for business support?
    
    Microsoft 365 Apps for business supports a maximum of 300 users. If you have more than 300 users or think you will soon, take a look at our [other plan options](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/compare-office-365-plans).
    
- ### What forms of payment can I use?
    
    Pay with all major credit cards, and your subscription amount will appear on your credit card statement. You have the option to receive an invoice and, depending on your choice of services, you’ll be billed monthly or annually. Receive an email message when your invoice is ready to be viewed and, if a purchase order number is entered when you buy your subscription, that number is included in your invoice.
    
- ### What payment options are available? Can I pay monthly or annually?
    
    Choose a monthly commitment payment or an annual commitment payment for Microsoft 365.
    
    - Monthly commitment payment: Pay month by month and cancel at any time.
    - Annual commitment payment: Sign up for a one-year subscription and benefit from a discount for using this payment option. By default, your billing plan will be set to monthly billing. After your purchase, you can change your billing plan to annual billing within the Admin Portal.
    
- ### Can I cancel my subscription at any time?
    
    You can cancel your subscription at any time; you may be entitled to a partial refund. Read the complete [Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=403930).
    
- ### What happens to my data if I cancel my subscription?
    
    Your data is yours. If you decide to cancel your Microsoft 365 subscription, download your data—for example, your email and documents on team sites—and save it to another location. You should save your data before you cancel. After you cancel your subscription, data associated with your Microsoft 365 account will be available to your administrator(s) in a limited function account for 90 days.
    
- ### Can I switch to other Microsoft 365 plans?
    
    Yes, you can transition your account to a different plan.
    
    In most cases, you can use the switch plans wizard in your Admin Center to upgrade your plan. If your subscription has more than 300 users or if you used a prepaid card to purchase your plan, the switch plans wizard is not available. Plans that are not eligible for the switch plans wizard can be upgraded manually. Learn more about [switching Microsoft 365 plans](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=402442).  
    
    NOTE: When you change your account, your domain name is transferred to your new account, whether you brought your own domain name to the Microsoft 365 account or you set up a domain name with Microsoft 365.  
    
- ### What is Microsoft 365?
    
    Microsoft 365 is the productivity cloud designed to help each of us achieve what matters, in our work and life, with best-in-class Microsoft 365 apps, intelligent cloud services, and advanced security.
    
- ### See all our FAQs, search through our comprehensive Microsoft 365 Support articles.
    
    There are no price or feature changes for small and medium business plans. The same plans are available and only the plan names have been updated.

    - Right-click on the meeting invite in your Teams calendar and select **Chat with participants**. Go to the Whiteboard tab at the top of the meeting chat to add content and get the board ready.
    - After joining a Teams meeting, select the **Share** icon in the share tray of that meeting.

     Access the same whiteboard after the meeting and continue working on it from the Whiteboard tab in the meeting chat or in the Whiteboard app. [Learn more about using Whiteboard in Teams](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2229873).

    ### What are some tips for working remotely?
    
    Try these resources: 
    
    - [4 Tips for working from home with Microsoft Teams](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2143676)

- **13/**
    
    ### Can I also use Whiteboard in the classroom?
    
    Yes, Whiteboard was designed for remote and in-classroom learning. In the classroom, students leave the class with a digital version of the whiteboard, so they can focus on listening and learning instead of copying content from the whiteboard during class.  
      
    Teachers can run more interactive lessons using a shared whiteboard where students can add their content or react to content added by others. Whiteboard is a great tool for working on group projects, keeping all project members engaged, and giving teachers an opportunity to watch and provide feedback.
    
- **14/**
    
    ### How does read-only mode work?
    
    Read-only mode for Whiteboard in a Teams meeting allows the meeting organizer to choose how they want participants to interact with the board. When a presenter chooses read-only mode, all other meeting participants on the whiteboard will have a view-only experience. At any time during the meeting, the organizer can allow collaboration from others from the Settings menu. For enterprise customers, whiteboards default to collaboration mode. For education customers, teachers can choose read-only or collaboration mode before creating each whiteboard.
    
- **15/**
    
    ### How does Whiteboard work with OneNote?
    
    Whiteboard allows you to export your board to your OneNote class notebooks with the **Send to OneNote** option in the settings menu.

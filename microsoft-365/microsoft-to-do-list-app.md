- **01/**
    
    ### What is the purpose of a to-do list?
    
    The main purpose of a to-do list is to easily see all your priorities to ensure that you don't forget anything and can effectively plan to finish tasks on time. A well-maintained to-do list will set your mind at ease because you’ll always have a clear picture of what you need to get done.
    
- **02/**
    
    ### Why is a to-do list important?
    
    A to-do list is important because it keeps your tasks and obligations in order. An organized list makes things more manageable and keeps you mentally focused on the tasks at hand.
    
- **03/**
    
    ### When should I make a to-do list?
    
    The best time to make a daily to-do list is either the night before or first thing in the morning. The biggest benefit of a well-organized to-do list is the peace of mind that comes with having a plan in place.
    
- **04/**
    
    ### How many items should be on a to-do list?
    
    It's important to keep your to-do list manageable, so you don’t feel stressed. Consider making to-do lists with three items maximum. If you need to have more than three, limit yourself to one "big" task and fill the list out with some "medium" or "small" tasks that are easy to accomplish.
    
- **05/**
    
    ### How do I create a to-do list on my phone?
    
    To-do list apps, such as Microsoft To Do, are a great to create a to-do list on your phone. With Microsoft To Do, you can easily make and sync task lists across multiple devices, so you have all your lists available, whether you’re on your desktop, phone, or tablet.

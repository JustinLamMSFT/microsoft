## Frequently asked questions

Expand all | Collapse all

- ### What are the main differences between E3 and E5?
    
    Enterprise Mobility + Security E5 includes new and advanced security capabilities that make up our holistic and innovative approach to security for the mobile enterprise. Some E5 capabilities were previously only available as standalone products, such as Microsoft Cloud App Security, Microsoft Entra ID Protection, Microsoft Entra privileged identity management, and Microsoft Purview Information Protection.
    
- ### I currently use Enterprise Mobility + Security E3. Is there a discount for me to upgrade my users to E5?
    
    No, Microsoft doesn't offer an E5 discount for existing E3 customers.
    
- ### Enterprise Mobility + Security includes Microsoft Purview Information Protection. How is this included service different from the data loss prevention capabilities of Microsoft 365?
    
    Both technologies assist in the goal of data loss prevention and are complementary. Microsoft Purview Information Protection helps ensure that data you are working on is classified, labelled, and protected based on business data policies. Microsoft 365 offers similar capabilities, but from within Microsoft 365 services: Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft SharePoint. Use these technologies together to achieve combined, significant levels of data protection.
    
- ### I already have Microsoft 365. How does it integrate with Enterprise Mobility + Security?
    
    Microsoft Intune, included with Enterprise Mobility + Security, lets you manage Microsoft 365 mobile apps so you can maintain the rich, productive Microsoft 365 user experience while Intune helps keep your corporate data secure. Additionally, Microsoft Entra ID, used by Microsoft 365, enhances Enterprise Mobility + Security by including features like self-service password reset, group membership, and advanced machine learning-based security and usage reporting.
    
- ### What platforms does Intune support?
    
    Intune provides mobile device and application management across popular platforms: Windows, Mac OS X, Windows Phone, iOS, and Android. When Intune is connected with Microsoft Intune Configuration Manager in a hybrid configuration, you can also manage Macs, Unix and Linux servers, and Windows Server machines from a single management console.
    
- ### Can I buy the Enterprise Mobility + Security components as standalone products?
    
    Some Enterprise Mobility + Security E5 components are available for purchase separately, including Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft Advanced Threat Analytics, and Intune. However, the components are designed to work together, creating a comprehensive solution to help you determine your mobility and security strategy, today and into the future. Purchasing the suite also represents a better value compared to purchasing the individual components.

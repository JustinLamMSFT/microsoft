## Frequently asked questions

Expand all | Collapse all

- ### What are the three main types of cloud security?
    
    Cloud security differs based on the type of cloud computing being used. There are four main categories of cloud computing:
    
    - **Private cloud services**—The private cloud is defined as computing services offered over the Internet or a private internal network and only to select users instead of the general public.  
          
        
    - **Public cloud services**—Public cloud services include software-as-a-service (SaaS), infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solutions provided by a third party.  
          
        
    - **Hybrid cloud services**—Hybrid cloud services use a combination of private and public cloud computing configurations developed based on factors like cost, access, overall purpose, and security.
    
- ### Why is cloud security important?
    
    Cloud computing is a must for organizations who want to accelerate innovation and achieve complete digital transformation. Cloud security is the main line of defense organizations have against threats to their cloud computing data and infrastructure.
    
- ### What does cloud security defend against?
    
    Cloud security defends against a wide spectrum of current and emerging cybersecurity threats, including malware, hackers, and network intrusion attempts. It also maintains proper access for people with the right credentials.

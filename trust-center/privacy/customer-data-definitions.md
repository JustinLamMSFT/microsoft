### Customer data

  

Customer data is all data, including text, sound, video or image files, and software that you provide to Microsoft or that’s provided on your behalf through your use of Microsoft enterprise online services, excluding Microsoft Professional Services. It includes customer content, which is the data you upload for storage or processing and apps you upload for distribution through a Microsoft enterprise cloud service.

For example, customer content includes Exchange Online email and attachments, Power BI reports, SharePoint Online site content, or instant messaging conversations.

### Personal data

“Personal Data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, such as a name, an identification number, location coordinates, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.

Microsoft uses the same GDPR definition for personal data. It includes pseudonymized data. In addition to being a subset of administrator data and payment data, personal data is a subset of each of the data categories presented above.

### Professional services data

Professional Services Data means all data, including all text, sound, video, image files or software, that are provided to Microsoft, by or on behalf of a Customer (or that customer authorizes Microsoft to obtain from a Product) or otherwise obtained or processed by or on behalf of Microsoft through an engagement with Microsoft to obtain Professional Services.

### Administrator data

Administrator data is information about administrators supplied during signup, purchase, or administration of Microsoft services, such as names, phone numbers, and email addresses. It also includes aggregated usage information and data associated with your account, such as the controls you select. We use administrator data to provide services, complete transactions, service the account, and detect and prevent fraud.

### Payment data

Payment data is the information you provide when you buy something online with Microsoft. It may include a credit card number and security code, name, billing address, and other financial data. We use payment data to complete transactions and to detect and prevent fraud.

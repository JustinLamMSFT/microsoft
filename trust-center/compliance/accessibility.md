## How Microsoft integrates accessibility

Our commitment to accessibility is guided by three main principles: transparency, inclusivity and accountability. In developing our products and services, we take into account leading global accessibility standards, including:

- EN 301 549
- U.S. Section 508
- Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

Microsoft also works with governments and organizations around the world to deliver the benefits of digital technology to people with disabilities.

## Accountability

We prioritize inclusive design and accessibility in products and services. Microsoft publishes Accessibility Conformance Reports (ACRs) describing how our products and services support the criteria of the European accessibility standard, EN 301 549; Section 508 of the U.S. Rehabilitation Act; and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
